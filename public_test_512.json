In restaurants,  they should ask whether an allergycausing ingredient is in the food. A food allergy occurs when the immune system reacts to a certain food,  usually within minutes after the food has been consumed. Symptoms may include throat swelling,  trouble breathing,  or a rash. Strictly avoiding the allergycausing food is the only absolute way to avoid a reaction. Several foods account for 90 of allergic reactions. They include peanuts,  tree nuts walnuts,  pecans,  etc. ,  fish,  shellfish,  eggs,  milk,  soy,  and wheat.",

The product has been found to contain raised levels of bromate,  which exceed the permitted quantity stated in the Natural Mineral Water,  Spring Water and Bottled Drinking Water Regulations 1999 as amended. The product has been on sale throughout the UK in retail outlets and from vending machines. The product recalled is All Dasani bottled still water No other Coca Cola products are known to be affected Local authorities may wish to refer to the Food Standard Agencys web statement and QA regarding Dasani water attached below. The CocaCola Company has issued a press statement see attached. In addition a consumer care line has been set up by the company,  the number for which is 0800 227 711. Product withdrawal statement issued by the CocaCola Company Voluntary withdrawal of Dasani in UK 11. 45 am Friday 19 March To ensure that only products of the highest quality are provided to our consumers,  CocaCola is voluntarily withdrawing all Dasani products currently in the marketplace in the UK. The withdrawal began on Friday,  19 March 2004,  and will be 8085 per cent completed within 24 hours. Calcium is a legal requirement in all bottled water products in the UK,  including Dasani. To deliver the required calcium,  we add back calcium chloride into the product. Through detailed analysis,  we discovered that our product did not meet our quality standards. Because of the high level of bromide contained in the calcium chloride,  a derivate of bromide,  bromate,  was formed at a level that exceeded UK legal standards. This occurred during the ozonisation process we employ in manufacturing. Immediately after we identified this issue,  we consulted with the Food Standards Agency. The FSA has confirmed that there is no immediate health or safety issue. The withdrawal is a precautionary measure. If consumers have concerns or wish to return product purchased they should contact the free phone consumer care line 0800 227 711. The care line number appears on all Dasani packs. We are working closely with all our stockists to remove the product from the marketplace. This withdrawal only affects Dasani in the UK market.",

January 13,  2009 Peanut Corporation of America PCA,  a peanut processing company and maker of peanut butter for bulk distribution to institutions,  food service industries,  and private label food companies,  today announced a voluntary recall of peanut butter produced in its Blakely,  Georgia processing facility because it has the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella. All product affected was produced on or after July 1,  2008,  specific to the lot numbers and descriptions listed below. The peanut butter being recalled is sold by PCA in bulk packaging to distributors for institutional and food service industry use. It is also sold under the brand name Parnells Pride to those same industries. Additionally,  it is sold by the King Nut Company under the label King Nut. PCA customers who received the recalled product are being notified by telephone and in writing. None of the peanut butter being recalled is sold directly to consumers through retail stores. We deeply regret that this has happened,  said Stewart Parnell,  owner and president of PCA. Out of an abundance of caution,  we are voluntarily withdrawing this product and contacting our customers. We are taking these actions with the safety of our consumers as our first priority. PCA initiated this recall after an open container of King Nut brand peanut butter in a longterm care facility in Minnesota was found to contain a strain of salmonella. King Nut brand peanut butter is produced by PCA. According to the Minnesota Department of Health and Minnesota Department of Agriculture,  the Minnesota laboratory analyses on the contamination in the alreadyopened container of peanut butter have the same genetic fingerprint as the cases in the national outbreak that has sickened almost 400 people in 42 states. The voluntary recall of 21 lots of its peanut butter,  in containers ranging from five to 50 pounds,  is being taken immediately. PCA is notifying its institutional customers and has set up a tollfree hotline number 18775647080 to answer questions. PCA is continuing to work closely and cooperating with the Food and Drug Administration FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC,  as well as state officials as part of this ongoing investigation. According to a CDC update issued on their website today January 13,  2009,  preliminary analysis of an epidemiologic study conducted by CDC and public health officials has suggested peanut butter as a likely source.",

S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. Spinal cord and vertebral column are considered a specified risk material SRM and must be removed from cattle over 30 months of age in accordance with FSIS regulations. SRMs are tissues that are known to contain the infective agent in cattle infected with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy BSE,  as well as materials that are closely associated with these potentially infective tissues. Therefore,  FSIS prohibits SRMs from use as human food to minimize potential human exposure to the BSE agent. The products subject to recall include 1 BEEF CARCASS,  which bears the establishment number EST. 04488 M inside the USDA mark of inspection. The product was packed on January 7,  2010,  and sold to a single customer in New York. The problem was discovered through routine FSIS inspection activities. FSIS has received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of this product. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers including restaurants of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. FSIS became aware of the problem on July 15 when the agency was notified by the California Department of Public Health CDPH of a small E. coli O157H7 cluster of illnesses with a rare strain as determined by PFGE subtyping. A total of six patients with illness onset dates between April 8 and June 18,  2010 were reported at that time. After further review,  CDPH added another patient from February to the case count,  bringing the count to seven. FSIS is continuing to work with the CDPH and the company on the investigation. Anyone with signs or symptoms of foodborne illness should contact a health care provider. PREPARING GROUND BEEF FOR SAFE CONSUMPTION USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline 1888MPHOTLINE or visit www. fsis. usda. gov Wash hands with warm,  soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw meat and poultry. Wash cutting boards,  dishes and utensils with hot,  soapy water. Immediately clean spills. Keep raw meat,  fish and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat,  poultry and egg products and cooked foods. Consumers should only eat ground beef or ground beef patties that have been cooked to a safe internal temperature of 160 F. Color is NOT a reliable indicator that ground beef or ground beef patties have been cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria such as E. coli O157H7. The only way to be sure ground beef is cooked to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use a thermometer to measure the internal temperature. Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase or one hour if temperatures exceed 90 F. Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.

Reason For Issuing Alert Batches of the affected milk powder were recalled by its Japanese manufacturer following detection of radioactive substances. Action Taken by the Centre for Food Safety The Centre for Food Safety CFS met with representatives of importers distributors and learnt that the affected batches have not been put on sale in the local market. The CFS has deployed staff to inspect the retail outlets and has,  so far,  not found any cans of the affected batches on the shelves. The CFS will continue to liaise with the Japanese authorities on the Japan nuclear incident,  closely monitor the situation and take appropriate followup actions. Advice to the Trade Stop importing or selling the affected products. Advice to Consumers If consumers have bought Meiji milk powder,  check the label on the cans to see whether they were the affected batches. Patronise reliable shops. If in doubt,  ask distributors to have a look at the letter issued by the CFS stating that the concerned Japanese food consignments had passed the CFS radiation test. According to the test results released by Meiji Dairies Corporation,  the radiation levels detected in the milk powder concerned were very low and unlikely to cause adverse health effects. Further Information The CFS press release The surveillance results on Japanese food products will continue to be uploaded to the CFS website www. cfs. gov. hk on working days.

Illness onset dates among these five casepatients ranged from June 6,  2012 to June 13,  2012. Two of the five casepatients were hospitalized. Leftover product with no packaging information collected during the course of this investigation by the Vermont Department of Health tested positive for Salmonella Enteritidis with the outbreak strain. This outbreak strain of Salmonella Enteritidis is drug sensitive,  meaning antibiotics can be effective in treating patients who need them. FSIS is continuing to work with CDC and public health partners on the investigation. Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis,  one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. Salmonella infections can be lifethreatening,  especially to those with weak immune systems,  such as infants,  the elderly,  and persons with HIV infection or those undergoing chemotherapy. The most common manifestations of salmonellosis are diarrhea,  abdominal cramps,  and fever within 12 to 72 hours. Additional symptoms may be chills,  headache,  nausea and vomiting that can last up to seven days. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact a health care provider. FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products,  including fresh and frozen,  and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature. Consumers who have questions are encouraged to call the companys consumer information line at 888 8121646.

People experiencing these problems should seek immediate medical attention. Products were distributed to the following states Illinois,  Indiana,  Michigan,  Georgia,  Tennessee,  Kentucky,  North Carolina,  South Carolina,  Ohio,  Wisconsin,  New Jersey,  Pennsylvania,  Florida,  and Alabama. A routine sample of Asadero cheese,  taken by an inspector from the Michigan Department of Agricultures Food and Dairy Division on February 23,  2009,  was subsequently tested by the Michigan Department of Agriculture Laboratory and discovered to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes.

February 8,  2009 In connection with the January 28,  2009 expanded recall announcement issued by Peanut Corporation of America PCA,  the company wishes to highlight important information regarding several of its products. On January 28,  2009,  PCA announced it was voluntarily recalling all peanuts and peanut products processed in its Blakely,  Georgia facility since January 1,  2007 because they have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella. Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children,  frail or elderly people,  and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever,  diarrhea which may be bloody,  nausea,  vomiting,  and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances,  infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections i. e. ,  infected aneurisms,  endocarditis and arthritis. For more information on Salmonella,  please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Website at httpwww. cdc. gov. PCA has not manufactured any products in cans and jars since 2007. However,  because the January 28th recall notice indicated that PCA does not sell products directly to consumers in stores,  and because the expanded recall includes PCA products made since the beginning of 2007,  the potential for confusion may exist. Therefore,  the company is highlighting information about those former retail offerings to assist consumers who may have purchased those products and who may still have them in their possession. These products were part of the January 28th recall,  but here,  they are individually listed. Consumers should be aware that the list below includes only PCAs own brands that were sold to consumers at retail. The list does not include brands made by PCA for other firms. FDA continues to update its website to alert the public about any new recalls. PCA sold its Caseys,  Parnells Pride,  Reggie,  and Robinson Crusoe labels to 99 Cent Stuff,  99 Cents Only Stores,  Dollar General,  and Dollar Tree Stores. Below is a list of items and UPC codes that were shipped to these discount retail chain stores and other customers that are affected by this recall UPC Pack Size Description Affected PCA has not received any complaints or reports of illness from any of the items highlighted in this update.

This recall was initiated due to concerns about a group of Salmonella Heidelberg illnesses that may be associated with the consumption of rotisserie chicken products prepared in and purchased at the Costco El Camino Real store. The PFGE pattern 0258 associated with this outbreak is reported rarely in the United States. FSIS,  working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC,  the California Department of Public Health and the County of San Mateo Public Health Department,  determined through epidemiologic and traceback investigations that there is a link between the Costco El Camino Real rotisserie chicken products and this illness outbreak. FSIS is continuing to work with CDC,  public health partners in California and Costco on the investigation. FSIS will continue to provide information as it becomes available. This group of illnesses is part of a larger cluster of Salmonella Heidelberg illnesses that are known to be multidrug resistant.

        "text": "Year: 2013, Month: 10, Day: 12, Country: us, Title: California Wholesale Store Recalls Rotisserie Chicken Products Due to Possible Salmonella Heidelberg Contamination - FSIS further reminds consumers of the critical importance of following package cooking instructions for frozen or fresh chicken products and general food safety guidelines when handling and preparing any raw meat or poultry. In particular,  while cooking instructions may give a specific number of minutes of cooking for each side of the product in order to attain 165 F internal temperature,  consumers should be aware that actual time may vary depending on the cooking method broiling,  frying,  or grilling and the temperature of the product chilled versus frozen so it is important that the final temperature of 165 F must be reached for safety. Please do not rely on the cooking time for each side of the product,  but use a food thermometer. All poultry products should be cooked to a safe minimum internal temperature of 165 F as determined by a food thermometer. Using a food thermometer is the only way to know that food has reached a high enough temperature to destroy foodborne bacteria. Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis,  one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. Salmonella infections can be lifethreatening,  especially to those with weak immune systems,  such as infants,  the elderly,  and persons with HIV or undergoing chemotherapy. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea,  abdominal cramps and fever within eight to 72 hours. Additional symptoms may be chills,  headache,  nausea and vomiting that can last up to seven days. Consumers with food safety questions can Ask Karen,  the FSIS virtual representative available 24 hours a day at AskKaren. gov. The tollfree USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline 1888MPHotline 18886746854 is available in English and Spanish and can be reached from 10 a. m. to 4 p. m. Eastern Time Monday through Friday. Recorded food safety messages are available 24 hours a day. Recommendations for Preventing Salmonellosis Wash hands before and after handling raw meat and poultry with warmhot preferred or cold soapy running water by rubbing hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds. Also wash cutting boards,  dishes and utensils with hot preferred,  soapy water and clean up any spills right away. The mechanical action of vigorous rubbing of hands and utensilssurfaces creates friction that helps to dislodge bacteria and viruses from hands and surfaces. Additionally,  warmhot water helps to dissolve fatsfoods,  aiding in cleaningmicrobe removal and can also assist in deactivation of pathogens.",

However,  sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs,  including viruses. Keep raw meat,  fish and poultry away from other food that will not be thoroughly cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat,  poultry,  and their juices and thoroughly cooked foods. Thoroughly cook raw meat and poultry to safe internal temperatures 160º F for ground meat such as beef and pork and 165º F for all poultry,  as measured with a food thermometer before eating. Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase one hour if temperatures exceed 90º F. Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.",

S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The beef products were produced on various dates between March 25,  2014 and February 19,  2015.

The products subject to recall bear the establishment number EST. 13545 inside the USDA mark of inspection. These products were shipped for hotels,  restaurants and institutional use in Texas. The problem was discovered when FSIS personnel reviewed historical sampling data in the context of recent intensified verification testing with multiple Listeria monocytogenes positives. The historical sampling showed a recurrence of Lm isolates with indistinguishable Pulsedfield Gel Electrophoresis PFGE patterns over a period of time within the establishment. The presence of isolates with indistinguishable PFGE patterns in environmental samples including food contact and nonfood contact surfaces and on readytoeat meat products indicates that there are insufficient sanitary measures to prevent contamination of the production environment and the products with Lm. Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis,  a serious infection that primarily affects older adults,  persons with weakened immune systems,  and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly,  persons outside these risk groups are affected. Listeriosis can cause fever,  muscle aches,  headache,  stiff neck,  confusion,  loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women,  the infection can cause miscarriages,  stillbirths,  premature delivery or lifethreatening infection of the newborn. In addition,  serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higherrisk categories who experience flulike symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.",

S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The fully cooked beef and pork pepper stick jerky product was produced on March 24,  2015. The following product is subject to recall 6 individual Cryovac sticks of Smoked Beef Pork Pepper Stick with package code 032420150004. The product subject to recall bears the establishment number EST. 19962M inside the USDA mark of inspection. This product was shipped to local retail outlets in Washington. The problem was discovered by the company after a sample from the cutting board used in preparation of the product returned a positive test result for Listeria monocytogenes. FSIS and the company have received no reports of illness due to consumption of this product. Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis,  a serious infection that primarily affects older adults,  persons with weakened immune systems,  and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly,  persons outside these risk groups are affected. Listeriosis can cause fever,  muscle aches,  headache,  stiff neck,  confusion,  loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women,  the infection can cause miscarriages,  stillbirths,  premature delivery or lifethreatening infection of the newborn. In addition,  serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higherrisk categories who experience flulike symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. FSIS advises all consumers to reheat readytoeat product until steaming hot. Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Mitch Truax,  Operations Manager,  at 509 9332211.

The following products are subject to recall Varying weights of Whole Hogs for Barbeque The product subject to recall bears the establishment number Est. 1628 inside the USDA mark of inspection. The product was shipped to various individuals,  retail locations,  institutions,  and distributors in Alaska and Washington. On July 15,  2015,  the Washington State Department of Health notified FSIS of an investigation of Salmonella I4, 5, 12iillnesses. Working in conjunction with the Washington State Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC,  FSIS determined that there is a link between whole hogs for barbeque from Kapowsin Meats and these illnesses. Traceback investigation has identified 32 casepatients who consumed whole hogs for barbeque from this establishment prior to illness onset. These illnesses are part of a larger illness investigation. Based on epidemiological evidence,  134 casepatients have been identified in Washington with illness onset dates ranging from April 25,  2015 to July 29,  2015. FSIS continues to work with our public health partners on this ongoing investigation. Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis,  one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea,  abdominal cramps,  and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons,  however,  the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults,  infants,  and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers freezers. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

People can become ill from STECs 28 days average of 34 days after consuming the organism. Most people infected with STEC O121 develop diarrhea often bloody,  and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment;  antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended. Most people recover within a week,  but,  rarely,  some develop a more severe infection. Hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS is uncommon with STEC O121 infection. HUS can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old,  older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. It is marked by easy bruising,  pallor,  and decreased urine output.",

According to the information provided by the New Zealand authorities,  the abovementioned seven kinds of affected products have been imported to Hong Kong by an importer,  Lee Fish Asia Limited. Listeria monocytogenes can be easily destroyed by cooking but can survive and multiply at refrigerator temperatures. Most healthy individuals do not develop symptoms or only have mild symptoms like fever,  muscle pain,  headache,  nausea,  vomiting or diarrhoea when infected. However,  severe complications such as septicemia,  meningitis or even death may occur in newborns,  the elderly and those with a weaker immune system. Although infected pregnant women may just experience mild symptoms generally,  the infection of Listeria monocytogenes may cause miscarriage,  infant death,  preterm birth,  or severe infection in the newborns. Action Taken by the Centre for Food Safety Upon learning of the incident,  the CFS immediately followed up with the importer concerned. The importer confirmed that about 39 kilograms of the abovementioned products have been imported to Hong Kong and were only supplied to citysuper supermarket for sale. The supermarket concerned has already stopped sale and removed from shelves the affected products. The CFS will continue to closely monitor the situation and take appropriate action to safeguard food safety and public health. Advice to the Trade Stop using or selling the products concerned immediately should they possess them. Advice to Consumers Not to consume the products concerned.",

S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The Monte Cristo turkey,  ham,  cheese,  on French toast sandwiches were produced from May 1,  2014 through February 1,  2017. The following products are subject to recall View Label PDF Only 13. 25lb. bulk cases containing 200 Kabobs MONTE CRISTO TURKEY BREAST,  HAM AND CHEESE SANDWICH in shrink wrapped plastic trays and bearing case codes PM14E27,  PM14H14,  PM14J10,  PM14E01,  PM14E12,  PM14E13,  PM15C26,  PM15E06,  PM15G23,  PM14L18,  PM15A08,  PM15C26,  PM15K20,  PM16B08,  PM16B09,  PM16F22,  PM16F24,  and PM17B01. The products subject to recall bear establishment number P6640 inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to institutional locations in Florida,  Georgia,  South Carolina,  and Texas. The problem was discovered when Kabobs Acquisition,  Inc. ,  was notified by their French toast ingredient supplier,  that the French toast used in the sandwich products was recalled due to potential Lm contamination. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis,  a serious infection that primarily affects older adults,  persons with weakened immune systems,  and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly,  persons outside these risk groups are affected. Listeriosis can cause fever,  muscle aches,  headache,  stiff neck,  confusion,  loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women,  the infection can cause miscarriages,  stillbirths,  premature delivery or lifethreatening infection of the newborn. In addition,  serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higherrisk categories who experience flulike symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available,  the retail distribution lists will be posted on the FSIS website at www. fsis. usda. govrecalls.",

Arsenic when present in the diet at very high levels,  well above those detected in recent samples of Peñafiel,  is associated with numerous chronic diseases. Water quality tests of Peñafiel samples conducted by an independent laboratory on behalf of Keurig Dr Pepper detected arsenic at levels that exceeded the FD! s bottled water standards for mineral water of 10 ppb. All unflavored Peñafiel mineral spring water products including 600mL and 1. 5L of all date codes are included in this voluntary withdrawal. The product is packaged in PET bottle formats. Consumers who have this product in their possession can return it to their retailer for a full refund. Peñafiel is a small brand in the U. S. and quantities in the marketplace are very limited,  given that Keurig Dr Pepper has already begun to withdraw the products from the market. The Company has notified retailers that it will work with them to remove the product from the market. Arsenic is found in nature,  including in aquifers that are the source of mineral water and where levels can vary over time. Keurig Dr Pepper has recently installed enhanced filtration systems at its facilities that produce Peñafiel,  and the product now being produced is well within regulatory guidelines. No other Keurig Dr Pepper products are impacted by this voluntary removal. For further information,  please contact the Keurig Dr Pepper Consumer Care hotline at 800 6965891 between the hours of 900 am and 800 pm EST,  Monday through Friday.

S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The readytoeat sausage products were produced on Oct. 29,  2019,  Oct. 30,  2019 and Nov. 5,  2019. This spreadsheet contains a list of the products subject to the recall. View labelsPDF only The products subject to recall bear establishment number EST. 1838A inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to distribution centers in Indiana and Ohio. The problem was discovered when the firm notified FSIS of a positive sample result for Listeria monocytogenes. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider. Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis,  a serious infection that primarily affects older adults,  persons with weakened immune systems,  and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly,  persons outside these risk groups are affected. Listeriosis can cause fever,  muscle aches,  headache,  stiff neck,  confusion,  loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women,  the infection can cause miscarriages,  stillbirths,  premature delivery or lifethreatening infection of the newborn. In addition,  serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higherrisk categories who experience flulike symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food. FSIS is concerned that some product may be in distribution centers,  restaurants,  or institutional refrigerators or freezers. Restaurants and institutions that have purchased these products are urged not to serve them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available,  the retail distribution lists will be posted on the FSIS website atwww. fsis. usda. govrecalls.

For humans,  nausea,  gastrointestinal disturbances and vomiting have been reported. Action Taken by the Centre for Food Safety The CFS has informed the importerdistributor concerned of the irregularity. The importerdistributor has stopped sale and removed from shelves all batches of the affected product and initiated a recall according to the CFS instructions. Prosecution will be instituted should there be sufficient evidence. The CFS will alert the trade,  continue to follow up on the case and take appropriate action to safeguard food safety and public health. Advice to the Trade Stop using or selling the affected products immediately if they possess them. Advice to Consumers Not to consume the affected products. Further Information The CFS press release Members of the public may call the importerdistributors hotline at 2606 8658 for enquiries about the recall during office hours.

The recall is being conducted due to a possible health risk from E. coli in the two products. Dole Fresh Vegetables is coordinating closely with regulatory officials. No illnesses have been reported to date in association with the recall. Pathogenic E. coli can cause diarrhea,  severe stomach cramps and vomiting. Most people recover within a week,  but some illnesses can last longer and can be more severe. The HarvestedOn sticker is located on the upper right corner of each bag and the UPC code is located on the bottom right corner of the back of each bag. The Dole package contains three organic romaine hearts and the Wild Harvest product is packaged in a 12oz bag. The impacted products were distributed in AZ,  HI,  IA,  IL,  IN,  KS,  MD,  MI,  MN,  MO,  MS,  MT,  NC,  ND and VA. These products were harvested and packed nearly 4 weeks ago and should no longer be in commerce. Consumers are advised to check product they have in their homes and discard any product matching the production description,  UPC codes and HarvestedOn dates listed above. This precautionary recall notification is being issued due to an isolated instance in which a package of Dole Organic Romaine Hearts 3pk yielded a positive result for pathogenic nonO157 E. coli STEC in a routine sample collected at a retail store by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. There is no indication at this time that this positive result is related to any illnesses nor consumer complaints and it is not associated with the strains connected to the ongoing outbreaks currently under regulatory investigation. No other Dole products are included in the recall. This voluntary recall does not apply to any bagged or clamshell salad romaine product. Only the specific Organic Romaine Hearts listed,  with the exact UPC codes and HarvestedOn dates identified above,  are included in the recall. Consumers who have any remaining product with these UPC codes and HarvestedOn dates should not consume it,  but rather discard it.",

The recall does not include any metabolic deficiency nutrition formulas. Abbott is voluntarily recalling these products after four consumer complaints related to Cronobacter sakazakii or Salmonella Newport in infants who had consumed powder infant formula manufactured in this facility. Additionally,  as part of Abbotts quality processes,  we conduct routine testing for Cronobacter sakazakii and other pathogens in our manufacturing facilities. During testing in our Sturgis,  Mich. ,  facility,  we found evidence of Cronobacter sakazakii in the plant in nonproduct contact areas. We found no evidence of Salmonella Newport. This investigation is ongoing. Importantly,  no distributed product has tested positive for the presence of either of these bacteria,  and we continue to test. Abbott conducts extensive quality checks on each completed batch of infant formula,  including microbiological analysis prior to release. All finished products are tested for Cronobacter sakazakii,  Salmonella Newport and other pathogens and they must test negative before any product is released. Additionally,  retained samples related to the three complaints for Cronobacter sakazakii tested negative for Cronobacter sakazakii. And the retained sample related to the complaint for Salmonella Newport tested negative for Salmonella Newport. While Abbotts testing of finished product detected no pathogens,  we are taking action by recalling the powder formula manufactured in this facility with an expiration of April 1,  2022,  or later. No Abbott liquid formulas,  powder formulas,  or nutrition products from other facilities are impacted by the recall. Cronobacter sakazakii is commonly found in the environment and a variety of areas in the home. It can cause fever,  poor feeding,  excessive crying or low energy as well as other serious symptoms. Its important to follow the instructions for proper preparation,  handling and storage of powder formulas. We know parents depend on us to provide them with the highest quality nutrition formulas,  said Joe Manning,  executive vice president,  nutritional products,  Abbott. Were taking this action so parents know they can trust us to meet our high standards,  as well as theirs. We deeply regret the concern and inconvenience this situation will cause parents,  caregivers and health care professionals.",

Although the exact strain has yet to be determined customers must not eat this product as it may pose a serious health risk. Pathogenic Escherichia coli can cause diarrhea,  severe stomach cramps and vomiting. Most people recover within a week,  but some illnesses can last longer and can be more severe.
