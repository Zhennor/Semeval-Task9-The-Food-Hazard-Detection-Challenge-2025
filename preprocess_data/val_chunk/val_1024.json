The product subject to recall bears the establishment number P1358 inside the USDA mark of inspection. This product was shipped to retail stores and food service locations nationwide. FSIS was notified of a cluster of Salmonella Enteritidis illnesses on June 23,  2015. Working in conjunction with Minnesota State Departments of Health and Agriculture,  FSIS determined that there is a link between the frozen,  raw,  stuffed and breaded chicken products that appear to be readytoeat RTE from Aspen Foods and this illness cluster. Based on epidemiological evidence and traceback investigations,  five casepatients have been identified in Minnesota with illness onset dates ranging from May 9,  2015 to July 22,  2015. FSIS continues to work with the Minnesota Departments of Health and Agriculture as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on this investigation. Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis,  one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea,  abdominal cramps,  and fever within 12 to 72 hours after exposure to the organism. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons,  however,  the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults,  infants,  and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be in consumers freezers. Although the product subject to recall may appear to be cooked,  this product is in fact uncooked raw and should be handled carefully to avoid crosscontamination in the kitchen. Particular attention needs to be paid to safely prepare and cook these raw poultry products to a temperature of 165 F checking at the center,  the thickest part and the surface of the product. This frozen,  raw,  stuffed and breaded chicken product was labeled with instructions identifying that the product was raw and included cooking instructions for preparation. Some casepatients reported following the cooking instructions on the label and using a food thermometer to confirm that the recommended temperature was achieved. Therefore,  FSIS advises all consumers to treat this product like a raw chicken product. Hands and any surfaces,  including surfaces that may have breading dislodged from the product,  should be cleaned after contact with this raw product. Also,  keep raw poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use one cutting board for raw poultry and a separate one for fresh produce and cooked foods. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available,  the retail distribution lists will be posted on the FSIS website atwww. fsis. usda. govrecalls. Consumers with questions can contact the company directly at 844 2776802.",

Recalls Pork Products Due To Possible Salmonella Contamination - WASHINGTON,  July 21,  2016 Kapowsin Meats Inc. ,  a Graham,  Wash. establishment,  is recalling approximately 11, 658 pounds of pork products that may be contaminated with Salmonella I 4, 5, 12i,  the U. S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The whole roaster hogs were produced between June 13,  2016 and July 15,  2016. The following products are subject to recall View Label Varying weights of boxedbagged Whole Hogs for Barbeque The products subject to recall bear establishment number EST. 1628M inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to various individuals,  retail locations,  institutions,  and distributors in Washington. FSIS was notified of an illness investigation in Washington on July 13,  2016. The Washington State Department of Health updated FSIS on July 19,  2016 of confirmed casepatients involved in an illness outbreak of Salmonella I 4, 5, 12i. Working in conjunction with the Washington State Department of Health,  local health departments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC,  FSIS determined that there is a highly probable link between whole hogs for barbeque from Kapowsin Meats and this illness cluster. Based on epidemiological investigation,  three Salmonella I 4, 5, 12i casepatients have been identified with illness onset dates ranging from July 5,  2016,  to July 7,  2016. Traceback investigation indicated that three casepatients consumed whole hog roasters for barbeque from Kapowsin Meats. At this time,  it is not known if this outbreak strain has any drug resistance;  results are pending. This investigation is ongoing. FSIS continues to work with public health partners at the Washington State Department of Health,  local health and the CDC on this investigation. Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis,  one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea,  abdominal cramps,  and fever within 12 to 72 hours after exposure to the organism. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons,  however,  the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults,  infants,  and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available,  the retail distribution lists will be posted on the FSIS website at www. fsis. usda. govrecalls. FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products,  including fresh and frozen,  and only consume pork and whole hogs for barbeque that have been cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 145 F with a three minute rest time. The only way to confirm that whole hogs for barbeque are cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature,  http1. usa. gov1cDxcDQ. For whole hogs for barbeque make sure to check the internal temperature with a food thermometer in numerous places,  including near the bone. Check the temperature frequently and replenish wood or coals to make sure the fire stays hot. Remove only enough meat from the carcass as you can serve within 12 hours.

Coli O157:H7 Contamination - WASHINGTON,  Jan. 20,  2016 Snapps Ferry Packing Company,  an Afton,  Tenn. establishment,  is recalling approximately 410 pounds of beef product that may be contaminated with E. coli O157H7,  the U. S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The ground beef item was produced on Nov. 20,  2015. The following product is subject to recall View Label 5lb. packages of Ground Beef,  with a packaging date of Nov. 20,  2015. The product subject to recall bears establishment number Est. 9085 inside the USDA mark of inspection. The item was distributed to restaurants in the Knoxville,  Tenn. area. None of this product was sold at retail. The problem was discovered on Jan. 19,  2016,  when a positive result for E. coli O157H7 from FSIS testing was traced back to the establishment as a result of an ongoing illness investigation in Tennessee. FSIS is continuing to work with our public health partners at the Tennessee Department of Health and Knox County Health Department on this investigation and will provide updated information as it becomes available. E. coli O157H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration,  bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 28 days 34 days,  on average after exposure the organism. While most people recover within a week,  some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS. This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising,  pallor,  and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products,  including fresh and frozen,  and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 F. The only way to confirm ground and boneless beef products are cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature,  http1. usa. gov1cDxcDQ.

S. Food and Drug Administrations assessment of 23 reports about consumers having experienced liverrelated problems,  as well as a small number of published case reports,  was different from Iovates analysis. On May 1,  2009,  the FDA issued an advisory which states that,  Although the liver damage appears to be relatively rare,  FDA believes consumers should not be exposed to unnecessary risk. The number of adverse event reports described by the FDA is small relative to the many millions of people who have used Hydroxycut products over the 7 years referenced by the FDA. Iovates own assessment of the potential risk associated with the use of these products differs from that expressed by the Agency. Every product marketed by Iovate is evaluated during its development for the safety of its individual ingredients. Additionally,  independent thirdparty experts from the leading independent scientific firm specializing in ingredient assessment,  toxicology and product safety for the nutritional and pharmaceutical industry review the safety of Iovates ingredients and formulas before products are introduced in the marketplace. Only after this external review is completed does Iovate release a formula. However,  out of an abundance of caution and because consumer safety is Iovates top priority,  Iovate is voluntarily recalling these Hydroxycutbranded products. Consumers with questions about the recall can visit www. hydroxycutinformation. com for more information. Consumers can also contact the company by calling 18774682835 Monday through Friday between 9 am and 5 pm Eastern Daylight Time.",

The label is the same as that on the 1 litre bottle. The best before date is December 2005. To assist local authorities in correct identification of this product,  pictures can be viewed from the links at the foot of this page. Actions to be taken by local authorities This product presents a health risk if consumed in sufficient quantity,  and does not comply with the food safety requirements specified in the Food Safety Act 1990 due to contamination with Sudan IV. In addition Sudan IV is not a permitted colour. If this product is found within their area,  enforcement officers should ensure that it is withdrawn and destroyed,  if necessary using powers under The Food Safety Act. Jumbo UK Ltd has undertaken a trade withdrawal and displayed pointofsale notices in their retail outlet in the London Borough of Hackney. However,  the withdrawal has not been successful and there remains the possibility that unused affected product is in consumers homes. Local authorities are therefore asked to consider providing local publicity on this issue at the next available opportunity. It is essential that all nonunitary authorities liaise at county level to ensure that they coordinate their actions. It is expected that action by local authorities will be initiated as soon as possible after receipt of this food hazard warning.

People who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to peanuts run the risk of serious or lifethreatening allergic reaction if they consume these meals. The GochujangGlazed Pork Chop Bowl and GochujangGlazed Salmon Bowl meals were distributed through Tovalas weekly directtoconsumer meal delivery service to customers across the continental United States who selected the meals for delivery the week of July 4,  2022. Tovala directly notified customers by email and push notifications who were shipped the affected meals,  as well as disabled the QR codes used for cooking the meals. The GochujangGlazed Pork Chop Bowl and GochujangGlazed Salmon Bowl meals are packaged in individual meal sleeves or boxes that include a meal card with a QR code and labeled as GochujangGlazed Pork Chop Bowl and GochujangGlazed Salmon Bowl. The affected meals are marked with Enjoy By dates between 71122 through 71422. No other Tovala meals are impacted by this recall.

S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The frozen,  fully cooked chicken wrap items were produced on various dates from Oct. 15,  2017 through Oct. 15,  2018.

The products subject to recall bear establishment number EST. 45367 or EST. 20552 stamped on the product centerfold. These items were shipped directly to consumers through catalog sales in California,  Colorado,  Florida,  Hawaii,  Idaho,  Illinois,  Maryland,  Michigan,  North Carolina,  Oregon,  Pennsylvania and Texas. The problem was discovered on Oct. 14,  2018,  when SK Food Group received notification that the vegetables used in the production of their chicken wrap products were being recalled by their vegetable supplier due to Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella concerns. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider. Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis,  one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea,  abdominal cramps,  and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons,  however,  the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults,  infants,  and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider. Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis,  a serious infection that primarily affects older adults,  persons with weakened immune systems,  and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly,  persons outside these risk groups are affected. Listeriosis can cause fever,  muscle aches,  headache,  stiff neck,  confusion,  loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women,  the infection can cause miscarriages,  stillbirths,  premature delivery or lifethreatening infection of the newborn. In addition,  serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higherrisk categories who experience flulike symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food. FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available,  the retail distribution lists will be posted on the FSIS website at www. fsis. usda. govrecalls.

Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children,  frail or elderly people,  and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever,  diarrhea which may be bloody,  nausea,  vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare cases,  infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses,  such as arterial infections i. e. ,  infected aneurysms,  endocarditis and arthritis.

Although most healthy adults can recover completely within a week,  some people can develop a form of kidney failure called Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome HUS.

The product was distributed to grocery markets in Washington,  Idaho,  Montana,  Wyoming and Oregon. In addition,  Green Leaf Filets no label in five5 and ten10 pound containers are being recalled from foodservice accounts. The affected products distributed by Spokane Produce include green leaf lettuce that was originated and recalled from Adam Bros. Farming Inc. of Santa Maria,  CA. The recall was initiated after it was discovered that sediment from a reservoir near where the Adam Bros. Farm produce was grown tested positive for E. coli O157H7. Filtered and treated water from the reservoir may have come in contact with the produce after it was harvested. None of the filtered,  treated water has tested positive for E. coli,  all E. coli tests returning negative. We are taking extreme precautionary measures,  notes Dan Petek,  Spokane Produce spokesperson. To date,  there have been no cases of E coli or contamination from any Adam Bros. green leaf lettuce. In complete regard for the public at large and our customers,  we believe it is prudent at this point to be proactive and call in all product. Out of an abundance of caution,  as a service to the general consuming public at large,  product is being recalled in consultation with the Food and Drug Administration FDA.

Symptoms can include abdominal pain,  vomiting,  lethargy,  irritability,  weakness,  behavior or mood changes,  delirium,  seizures,  and coma. However,  infants,  young children and the developing fetus can be affected by chronic exposure to amounts of lead that may not result in obvious symptoms of lead poisoning. A child with lead poisoning may not look or act sick. Lead poising in children can cause learning disabilities,  developmental delays,  and lower IQ scores. Saladito products were sold andor distributed in California,  Nevada Utah through Independent Distributors and company Route Sales Representatives who in turn,  sold to many retail stores,  including Supermarkets,  Gas Stations and Convenient Stores.

The original release contained images of labels for products not included in the recall. WASHINGTON,  JULY 24,  2014 Great American Marketing,  a Houston,  Texas establishment,  is recalling approximately 475 pounds of FSIS and FDAregulated,  readytoeat products due to possible contamination with Listeria monocytogenes,  the U. S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The sandwich and wrap products were produced on July 15,  2014,  and then shipped to retail locations in Texas. Case labels or packaging may bear the sell by date of 072614. Products regulated by FSIS bear the establishment number EST 31680 or P31680 inside the USDA mark of inspection. The following FSISregulated products are subject to recall View Labels PDF Only 7. 4 ounce plasticcovered tray packages containing Chicken Caesar Wraps. 8. 1 ounce plasticcovered tray packages containing Club Wraps. FDAregulated products being recalled are listed at httpwww. fda. govsafetyrecalls and include 10. 5 ounce plasticcovered tray packages containing Ham and Cheddar Premium sandwiches. 10. 5 ounce plasticcovered tray packages containing Turkey Swiss Premium sandwiches. The problem was discovered when FSIS collected a sample of a separate product on July 15,  2014,  that was confirmed positive for L. monocytogenes on July 21. The sampled product was held. However,  the plant produced the additional FSIS and FDA regulated products listed in this recall without conducting a complete cleanup of the production equipment. Those products have entered commerce and are subject to recall. FSIS and the company have received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of these products. Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis,  a serious infection that primarily affects older adults,  persons with weakened immune systems,  and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly,  persons outside these risk groups are affected. Listeriosis can cause fever,  muscle aches,  headache,  stiff neck,  confusion,  loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women,  the infection can cause miscarriages,  stillbirths,  premature delivery or lifethreatening infection of the newborn. In addition,  serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higherrisk categories who experience flulike symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available,  the retail distribution lists will be posted on the FSIS website athttpwww. fsis. usda. govrecalls. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers freezers. FSIS advises all consumers to reheat readytoeat product until steaming hot.

Fairfax Meadow responded immediately to our concerns and are now changing their procedures. We are satisfied with the changes that are being made and at present we are not anticipating the need for enforcement action. Public health remains our top priority and at no stage has there been any indication that people have become ill from eating meat supplied by Fairfax Meadow. We,  along with local authorities,  are continuing to assess the situation and we are working with the business to oversee their product withdrawal.",

The following products are subject to FSIS recall 60lb. boxes of boneless veal The products subject to recall bear the establishment number M 27450 inside the USDA mark of inspection on a generic box label. The products were produced on June 17,  18,  24,  28 and 29,  2013 then distributed to wholesalers in New York and California for further processing. FSIS became aware of the problem during inspection program personnel review. The firm sampled the product per their food safety program,  and inadvertently shipped the product into commerce. FSIS and the company have received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of these products. Many clinical laboratories do not test for nonO157 Shiga toxinproducing E. coli STEC,  such as STEC O26,  O103,  O45,  O111,  O121 or O145 because it is harder to identify. Infections with Shiga toxinproducing E. coli can result in dehydration,  bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 28 days 34 days,  on average after exposure to the organism. While most people recover within a week,  some develop a type of kidney failure called Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome HUS. This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5 and older adults. Symptoms of HUS may include fever,  abdominal pain,  pale skin tone,  fatigue,  small,  unexplained bruises or bleeding from the nose and mouth,  decreased urination,  and swelling.

The product,  imported from Indonesia,  was used to prepare poke sold between April 27 May 1 by food establishments on Oahu. The imported frozen fish was used to prepare poke sold at Times Supermarket and Shimas locations in Aiea,  Kailua,  Kaneohe,  Kunia,  Liliha,  Mililani,  Waipahu,  and Waimanalo. The product was also used to prepare food served or sold by GP Hawaiian Food Catering,  the Crab Shack Kapolei also known as Maile Sunset Bar Grill in Kapolei,  Aloha Sushi at 3131 N. Nimitz,  and the ABC store at 205 Lewers St. Customers who purchased and consumed the product and are not vaccinated for hepatitis A are advised to consult with their doctor about vaccination. Times Supermarket and Tropic Fish notified the department as soon as they learned of the test results on the imported fish,  said Peter Oshiro,  chief of the DOH Food Safety Program. All of the product is being traced,  collected and held by the distributor. Fortunately,  in this case,  Tropic Fish Hawaii kept excellent records and has been contacting all retailers and pulling the product quickly. Because it generally takes two weeks for those infected to develop symptoms of hepatitis A,  vaccination or immune globulin can still provide some protection against the disease for those who may have been exposed in the last week,  said Dr. Sarah Park,  state epidemiologist. We remind those who received their first dose of hepatitis A vaccination during an earlier outbreak on Oahu to obtain their second dose for long term immunity. Persons who consumed poke from the affected food establishments between April 28 and May 1 may have been exposed to hepatitis A and are advised to Symptoms of hepatitis A infection usually appear 26 weeks after exposure and include fever,  fatigue,  loss of appetite,  abdominal discomfort,  dark urine,  diarrhea,  and yellow skin and eyes. Individuals,  including food service employees,  exhibiting symptoms of hepatitis A should stay home and contact their healthcare provider. Testing of individuals who do not have symptoms of hepatitis A is not recommended,  with the exception of food handlers who have been exposed to the disease,  as required by Hawaii State law. Hepatitis A vaccine or IG,  if indicated,  should be administered after results of the testing are received. DOH is working with the distributor and visiting all affected facilities to ensure proper sanitation and decontamination procedures are taken. The product is embargoed by the state until further testing is determined and coordination with federal authorities is completed. While vaccination provides the best protection,  frequent handwashing with soap and water after using the bathroom,  changing a diaper,  and before preparing food can help prevent the spread of hepatitis A. Appropriately cooking foods can also help to prevent infection. Additional information about hepatitis A is at httphealth. hawaii. govdocddisease_listinghepatitisa. For a statewide list of vaccinating pharmacies,  go to httphealth. hawaii. govdocdvaccinesimmunizationsvaccinelocators or call the Aloha United Way information and referral line at 211.",

Thoroughly cook ground meat such as beef to an internal temperature of 160 F,  as measured with a food thermometer,  before eating. Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase one hour if temperatures exceed 90 F. Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.

The products were produced on Oct. 17,  2012 and were distributed to restaurants in the Oahu,  HI area. The problem was discovered by FSIS and occurred as a result of the products testing positive for E. coli O157H7 and being shipped prior to the company receiving test results. FSIS and the company have received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of these products. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact a healthcare provider. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers including restaurants of the recall and to ensure that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. E. coli O157H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause bloody diarrhea,  dehydration,  and in the most severe cases,  kidney failure. The very young,  seniors and persons with weak immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness. FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products,  including fresh and frozen,  and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature. Consumers and media with questions regarding the recall should contact the companys Vice President,  Sheldon Wright,  at 808 5313591.",

January 28,  2009 Peanut Corporation of America PCA is voluntarily recalling all peanuts and peanut products processed in its Blakely,  Georgia facility since Jan. 1,  2007. Previously,  PCA announced a recall of peanut butter and peanut paste. PCA sells its products to institutional and industrial users for service in large institutions or for sale and further processing by other companies. PCA does not sell peanuts or peanut products directly to consumers in stores. PCA is not aware of any complaints or reports of illness involving the additional peanuts and peanut products subject to this expanded recall. PCA is acting out of an abundance of caution and with the U. S. Food and Drug Administrations help to recall all products manufactured in its Georgia facility. PCA is voluntarily taking this larger recall action following almost two weeks of inspection and review at the Georgia facility. The expanded recall includes all peanuts dry and oil roasted,  granulated peanuts,  peanut meal,  peanut butter and peanut paste. All of the recalled peanuts and peanut products were made only at the companys Blakely,  Georgia facility;  the lot numbers and a description of the products being recalled are listed at the end of this release. The Blakely,  Georgia facility has stopped producing all peanut products. The voluntary recall comes amid an FDA investigation into a nationwide salmonella outbreak that has sickened more than 500 people nationwide beginning in September,  with the largest number of illnesses reported in November. Salmonella is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children,  frail or elderly people,  and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever,  diarrhea which may be bloody,  nausea,  vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances,  infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections i. e. ,  infected aneurysms,  endocarditis and arthritis. Because some of our peanut products have been used by manufacturers of pet food,  we are also alerting the public that Salmonella is an organism that can potentially be transferred to people handling pet treats exposed to Salmonella,  especially if they have not thoroughly washed their hands after having contact with the products or any surfaces exposed to these products. Pets with Salmonella infections may be lethargic and have diarrhea or bloody diarrhea,  fever,  and vomiting. Some pets will have only decreased appetite,  fever and abdominal pain. Well animals can be carriers and infect other animals or humans. If your pet has consumed the recalled product and has these symptoms,  please contact your veterinarian. The potential for contamination was noted after samples from peanut butter containers and environmental samples from the Blakely,  Georgia facility tested positive for Salmonella. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration has said the investigation is very active and dynamic,  and PCA continues to work closely with the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as they continue their investigation into the nationwide outbreak of Salmonella. PCA is notifying customers who received recalled products by phone andor in writing. Customers should segregate and hold the product and call PCA at 18775647080 for further instructions. Consumers should contact the FDA and visit the agency web site at www. fda. gov for a complete list of all products affected. We have been devastated by this,  and we have been working around the clock with the FDA to ensure any potentially unsafe products are removed from the market immediately,  said Stewart Parnell,  President of Peanut Corporation of America. Additionally,  we are working alongside state and federal food safety experts in every way we can to help them protect consumers,  both now and in the future. We want our customers and consumers to know that PCA is taking extraordinary measures,  out of an abundance of caution,  to identify and recall all products that have been identified as potential risks. The recalled peanuts and peanut products were distributed nationwide to institutions,  food service industries,  and private label food companies as well as and in Canada,  Haiti,  Korea and Trinidad. All lots that are affected begin with the lot number 7,  8 or 9. The following is the description of the products being recalled Description Peanut Butter All Styles All Sizes All Lots beginning with 7,  8,  or 9 Peanut Paste All Styles All Sizes All Lots beginning with 7, 8,  or 9 Peanut Meal All Styles All Sizes All lots beginning with 7,  8,  or 9 Peanut Granules All Styles All Sizes All lots beginning with 7,  8 or 9 Peanuts All Styles All Sizes All lots beginning with 7,  8 or 9",

This product was purchased from an importer,  who,  along with the FDA,  are now in the process of contacting the source,  so that corrective action can be taken on their part. Use of,  or consumption of this product may elevate lead levels in the blood. Lead is a toxic substance present in our environment in small amounts and everyone is exposed to some lead from daily actions such as inhaling dust,  eating food,  or drinking water. In general,  the small exposure to lead within the U. S. population does not pose a significant public health concern. However,  exposure to larger amounts of lead can cause lead poisoning. While lead can affect nearly every bodily system,  its effects depend upon the amount and duration of lead exposure and age. Symptoms can include abdominal pain,  vomiting,  lethargy,  irritability,  weakness,  behavior or mood changes,  delirium,  seizures,  and coma. However,  infants,  young children and the developing fetus can be affected by chronic exposure to amounts of lead that may not result in obvious symptoms of lead poisoning. A child with lead poisoning may not look or act sick. Lead poisoning in children can cause learning disabilities,  developmental delays,  and lower IQ scores. Less than 20 cases of this product were shipped between June 15 and July 31 2018 to the following areas in the USA Michigan,  Minnesota,  Illinois,  Indiana,  Ohio,  Missouri and Colorado. We ask that all products with the Baraka Brand and UPC CODES 822514265566 AND 822514265535 be removed from shelfs and placed aside for pick up from a UBC company representative. Your notification must include instructions on what customers should do with the recalled product. Please ask consumers to cease use of product,  immediately return any unused portions to your outlet. You will then need to quarantine the items for pick up by an authorized person from our company. This recall should be carried out to the consumer level. Your assistance is appreciated and necessary to prevent and avoid any potential illness.

To ensure consumer safety,  Willamette Shelling has decided to recall all shelled hazelnuts processed at its facility from October 12th 2009 through November 25th 2009. Hazelnuts subject to the recall were shelled at Willamette Shellings facility on behalf of hazelnut processors. Shelled Hazelnuts processed by Willamette Shelling were returned to Oregon processors and a Canadian processor,  and were further distributed by those firms. Unshelled hazelnuts are not affected by this recall. All products subject to recall were packed in 25 lbs. and 50 lbs. corrugated boxes with lot code numbers 296091A,  299091A,  300091A,  VH3696BO,  and 310091A. Those corrugated boxes bore the following brand names Kunze Farms,  Evonuk Oregon Hazelnuts,  Canadian Hazelnuts,  and Firestone Farms. No illnesses have been reported to date. Hazelnut processors who used Willamette Shellings facility in 2009 are urged to return the product to Willamette Shelling.

S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service announced today. Preparing Ground Beef For Safe Consumption USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline 1888MPHOTLINE or visit www. fsis. usda. gov Although the products being recalled should be returned to the point of purchase,  consumers preparing other ground beef products should heed the following advice. Consumers should only eat ground beef patties that have been cooked to a safe temperature of 160 F. When a ground beef patty is cooked to 160 F throughout,  it can be safe and juicy,  regardless of color. The only way to be sure a ground beef patty is cooked to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use an accurate food thermometer. Color is not a reliable indicator that ground beef patties have been cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria such as E. coli O157H7. Eating a pink or red ground beef patty without first verifying that the safe temperature of 160 F has been reached is a significant risk factor for foodborne illness. Thermometer use to ensure proper cooking temperature is especially important for those who cook or serve ground beef patties to people most at risk for foodborne illness because E. coli O157H7 can lead to serious illness or even death. Those most at risk include young children,  seniors,  and those with compromised immune systems. The products subject to recall include View Labels 1. 5pound trays of ANGUS STEAK BURGER ALL NATURAL,  8515,  6 14 POUND PATTIES. 1. 33pound trays of ANGUS STEAK BURGER ALL NATURAL,  8515,  EXTRA THICK,  4 13 POUND PATTIES. 2. 25pound trays of 7327 ALL NATURAL GROUND BEEF,  CARNE MOLIDA DE RES. 5. 5pound trays of 7327 ALL NATURAL GROUND BEEF,  CARNE MOLIDA DE RES. Each label bears the establishment number Est. 244S inside the USDA mark of inspection as well as a Use or Freeze By date of JUN 13 07. The problem was discovered through trim sampling done by the company. The ground beef products were produced on June 2,  2007 and were distributed to retail establishments in Alabama,  Arkansas,  Colorado,  Kansas,  Kentucky,  Louisiana,  Missouri,  Mississippi,  New Mexico,  Oklahoma,  Tennessee and Texas. Consumers with questions about the recall should contact the Tyson Consumer Hotline at 800 2336332. Media with questions about the recall should contact company Director of Media Relations Gary Mickelson at 479 2906111. E. coli O157H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause bloody diarrhea and dehydration. The very young,  seniors and persons with compromised immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness.",

When there is a food allergy risk,  the FSA will issue an Allergy Alert. Get Allergy Alerts Subscribe to get Allergy Alerts by email or SMS text Ref 322017",

Coli Contamination - WASHINGTON,  Sept. 08,  2015 Schrader Farms Meat Market,  a Romulus,  N. Y. ,  establishment,  is recalling approximately 20 pounds of ground beef product that may be contaminated with nonO157 Shiga toxinproducing E. coli,  the U. S.

The following product is subject to recall View Labels PDF only 1lb. packages containing of SCHRADER FARMS Meat Market Ground Beef or SCHRADER FARMS Meat Market GROUND BEEF,  BULK with a pack date of September 2,  2015. The products subject to recall bear the establishment number Est. 44950 inside the USDA mark of inspection. These products were sold at the Schrader Farms retail store in Seneca County,  New York. The problem was discovered during routine establishment testing,  however this establishment released product into commerce prematurely Review of Testing Results. FSIS and the company have received no reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Many clinical laboratories do not test for nonO157 Shiga toxinproducing E. coli STEC,  such as STEC O26,  O103,  O45,  O111,  O121 or O145 because it is harder to identify than STEC O157. People can become ill from STECs 28 days average of 34 days after consuming the organism. Most people infected with nonSTEC E. coli develop diarrhea often bloody,  and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment;  antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended. Most people recover within a week,  but,  rarely,  some develop a more severe infection. Hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS is uncommon with STEC O26,  O103,  O45,  O111,  O121 or O145 infection. HUS can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old,  older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. It is marked by easy bruising,  pallor,  and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

Lead is a toxic substance present in our environment in small amounts and everyone is exposed to some lead from daily actions such as inhaling dust,  eating food,  or drinking water. Exposure to larger amounts of lead can cause lead poisoning. While lead can affect nearly every bodily system,  its effects depend upon the amount of and duration of lead exposure and age of the person exposed. Symptoms can include abdominal pain,  vomiting,  lethargy,  irritability,  weakness,  behavior or mood changes,  delirium,  seizures,  and coma. However,  infants,  young children and the developing fetus can be affected by chronic exposure to amounts of lead that may not result in obvious symptoms of lead poisoning. A child with lead poisoning may not look or act sick. Lead poising in children can cause learning disabilities,  developmental delays,  and lower IQ scores.

This action is the result of the Peanut Corporation of Americas expanded recall on January 28,  2009,  for all products manufactured in their Blakely,  Georgia facility since January 1,  2007. Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children,  frail or elderly people,  and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever,  diarrhea which may be bloody,  nausea,  vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances,  infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections i. e. ,  infected aneurysms,  endocarditis and arthritis. For more information on Salmonella,  please visit the Center for Disease Control and Preventions website at www. cdc. gov. Richs Nutty Sundae Cone is distributed in AL,  CA,  DE,  DC,  FL,  GA,  IL,  IN,  KS,  KY,  LA,  MD,  MA,  MI,  MS,  MO,  NV,  NH,  NJ,  NY,  NC,  OH,  OK,  PA,  PR,  SC,  TN,  TX,  VI,  VA,  Bahamas,  and Barbados in bulk packages of 24,  and sold to consumers in a 3 fl. oz. ,  coneshaped package with UPC 7545542000 printed on the individual package. Rich Ice Cream has received no reports of illnesses related to our product to date. No other products manufactured by Rich Ice Cream are involved in this recall.

The trade should stop using or selling the affected batches of the product concerned immediately if they possess it. Product details are as follows Product name Smoked Norwegian Salmon Slices with Dill Place of origin Hong Kong Net weight 100 grams per pack Useby date All batches on or after June 25,  2022 Distributor Polyfood Food Service Co. Ltd. The spokesman said,  The CFS collected the abovementioned smoked salmon sample from an online shop for testing under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The test result showed the presence of Listeria monocytogenes in 25 grams of the sample,  exceeding the standard of the Microbiological Guidelines for Food which states that Listeria monocytogenes should not be detected in 25 grams of food. The spokesman said that the CFS has informed the manufacturer concerned of the test result and instructed it to stop sale and remove from shelves the affected product,  and initiate a recall. For enquiries about the recall,  members of the public may call the manufacturer at 2898 99626366 0067 during office hours. Listeria monocytogenes can be easily destroyed by cooking but can survive and multiply at refrigerator temperature. Most healthy individuals do not develop symptoms or only have mild symptoms like fever,  muscle pain,  headache,  nausea,  vomiting or diarrhoea when infected. However,  severe complications such as septicaemia,  meningitis or even death may occur in newborns,  the elderly and those with a weaker immune system. Although infected pregnant women may just experience mild symptoms generally,  the infection of Listeria monocytogenes may cause miscarriage,  infant death,  preterm birth,  or severe infection in newborns,  the spokesman said. The spokesman urged consumers not to consume the affected product if they have bought any. The trade should also stop using or selling the product concerned immediately if they possess it. The CFS visited the concerned production facilities immediately for investigation and instructed the management to perform cleansing and disinfection. The CFS will alert the trade to the incident,  and will continue to follow up and take appropriate action. Investigation is ongoing. EndsThursday,  June 30,  2022",

Salmonella is an organism,  which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children,  frail or elderly people,  and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever,  diarrhea which may be bloody,  nausea,  vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances,  infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections i. e. infected aneurysms,  endocarditis and arthritis. For more information on Salmonella,  please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Website at httpwww. cdc. gov . The FDA and other regulatory agencies have been investigating Peanut Corporation of America PCA due to a recent Salmonella outbreak associated with various peanut products. The FDA has advised that all products produced by PCA from its Blakely,  Georgia facility are subject to recall,  including granulated peanuts. Fieldbrook utilized granulated peanuts from PCA for the topping on various ice cream sundae cone products. Fieldbrook is consequently recalling the ice cream sundae cone products that contain recalled granulated peanuts from PCA. The company has not received any complaints of consumer illnesses associated with these products. The products listed below have been distributed nationwide to retail and food service distribution centers as well as Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. The four additional items are as follows The following is a complete list of products affected by the recall. All lots prior to the code date listed are subject to the recall Our number one priority is consumer safety,  stated Kenneth Johnson,  President and CEO,  Fieldbrook Foods Corp.

Coli O157:H7 Adulteration - WASHINGTON,  Sept. 8,  2016 The Paradise Valley Market,  Inc. Carnival Supermarket,  located at 870 3rd Avenue,  Chula Vista,  Calif. ,  is voluntarily recalling approximately 35 pounds of ground beef products that may be adulterated with E. coli O157H7,  the U. S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The lean and extra lean ground beef was produced and sold only on Sept. 1,  2016. The following products are subject to recall 20lbs. of 15 lean ground beef product. The product would have been packaged to order and sold at the Carnival Supermarket meat counter in reddish plastic bags with a tied knot at the top. 15lbs. of 7 extra lean ground beef product. The product would have been packaged to order and sold at the Carnival Supermarket meat counter in reddish plastic bags with a tied knot at the top. The problem was discovered when FSIS received notification that a product sample collected at the firm tested positive for E. coli O157H7. There have been no confirmed reports of illness or adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. E. coli O157H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration,  bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 28 days 34 days,  on average after exposure the organism. While most people recover within a week,  some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS. This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising,  pallor,  and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately. FSIS and the company issued the voluntary recall over concerns that some product may be frozen and in consumers freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available,  the retail distribution lists will be posted on the FSIS website at www. fsis. usda. govrecalls. FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products,  including fresh and frozen,  and only consume product that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature,  http1. usa. gov1cDxcDQ. Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can call Sandy Young,  Vice President of J. Walcher Communications,  at 619 2957140.

S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service announced today. Preparing Ground Beef For Safe Consumption USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline 1888MPHOTLINE or visit www. fsis. usda. gov Although the products being recalled should be returned to the point of purchase,  consumers preparing other ground beef products should heed the following advice. Consumers should only eat ground beef patties that have been cooked to a safe temperature of 160 F. When a ground beef patty is cooked to 160 F throughout,  it can be safe and juicy,  regardless of color. The only way to be sure a ground beef patty is cooked to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use an accurate food thermometer. Color is not a reliable indicator that ground beef patties have been cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria such as E. coli O157H7. Eating a pink or red ground beef patty without first verifying that the safe temperature of 160 F has been reached is a significant risk factor for foodborne illness. Thermometer use to ensure proper cooking temperature is especially important for those who cook or serve ground beef patties to people most at risk for foodborne illness because E. coli O157H7 can lead to serious illness or even death. Those most at risk include young children,  seniors,  and those with compromised immune systems. The products subject to recall include 10pound boxes of PACKED FOR DAVIS MOUNTAIN ORGANIC BEEF,  100 CERTIFIED ORGANIC 31 BEEF PATTIES. Each box bears the lot code G6540 or G6544.

Each package bears the establishment number Est. 2424 inside the USDA mark of inspection. The problem was discovered through microbiological testing. FSIS has received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of this product. The ground beef products were produced on August 31 and September 1 and distributed to one retail establishment in Iowa and distributors in Georgia,  Iowa,  Massachusetts,  Nebraska,  New York,  Texas and Wisconsin. E. coli O157H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause bloody diarrhea and dehydration. The very young,  seniors and persons with compromised immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness. Media and consumers with questions about the recall should contact company President Jim Goeser at 712 7555158.",

S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The products subject to recall are any size package of the following 73 Hannaford Regular Ground Beef 75 Hannaford Regular Ground Beef 80 Hannaford Regular Ground Beef 85 Hannaford Regular Ground Beef 90 Hannaford Regular Ground Beef 80 Taste of Inspirations Angus Ground Beef 85 Taste of Inspirations Angus Ground Beef 90 Taste of Inspirations Angus Ground Beef 85 Natures Place Ground Beef 90 Natures Place Ground Beef This recall was initiated due to concerns about illnesses caused by an outbreak of salmonellosis that may be associated with use and consumption of fresh instore ground beef prepared in and purchased at Hannaford stores. The PFGE pattern associated with this outbreak is reported rarely in the U. S. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC have reported 14 ill persons with an indistinguishable PFGE pattern,  and 11 of those individuals reported consuming ground beef. Seven individuals were hospitalized and no deaths have been reported. Ten of the 14 casepatients reported purchasing ground beef at Hannaford stores in Maine,  New York,  New Hampshire and Vermont between Oct. 12 and Nov. 20. No other product description is available at this time. As a result of ongoing epidemiologic and traceback investigations,  as well as instore reviews,  FSIS,  working with the CDC and its state health partners,  determined that there is a link between the Hannaford ground beef products and this illness outbreak. FSIS is continuing to work with CDC,  public health partners in the affected states and the company on the investigation. FSIS will continue to provide information as it becomes available. The various ground beef packages bear sellby dates of Dec. 17,  2011 or earlier and were sold at Hannaford stores throughout Maine,  Massachusetts,  New Hampshire,  New York and Vermont. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers freezers. When available,  the retail distribution lists will be posted on FSIS website at www. fsis. usda. govFSIS_Recalls Open_Federal_Casesindex. asp. Recommendations for Preventing Salmonellosis This outbreak strain of Salmonella is resistant to many commonly prescribed antibiotics and its resistance can increase the risk of hospitalization or possible treatment failure in infected individuals. Wash hands with warm,  soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw meat and poultry. Also wash cutting boards,  dishes and utensils with hot soapy water. Clean up spills right away. Keep raw meat,  fish and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat,  poultry and egg products and cooked foods. Cook raw meat and poultry to safe internal temperatures before eating. The safe internal temperature for meat such as beef and pork is 160 F,  and 165 F for poultry,  as determined with a food thermometer. Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase one hour if temperatures exceed 90 F. Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking. The outbreak strain of Salmonella Typhimurium has initially tested resistant to multiple commonly prescribed antibiotics,  including drug classes such as betalactams,  aminoglycosides,  and cephalosporins. Additional information on drug resistance will be made public as it becomes available. Based on an examination of Hannafords limited records,  FSIS was unable to determine responsible suppliers. FSIS recently identified this problem at the retail level and is pursuing rulemaking to address the concern. This recall is being issued as part of a continuing investigation. FSIS has not yet been able to identify FSISregulated suppliers of raw beef ground at Hannaford Stores related to the outbreak that could be subject to recall action. Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis,  one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. Salmonella infections can be lifethreatening,  especially to those with weak immune systems,  such as infants,  the elderly,  and persons with HIV infection or those undergoing chemotherapy. The most common manifestations of salmonellosis are diarrhea,  abdominal cramps,  and fever within 12 to 72 hours. Additional symptoms may be chills,  headache,  nausea and vomiting that can last up to seven days. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact a health care provider. FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products,  including fresh and frozen,  and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature. Customers who have questions are encouraged to call the Hannaford Customer Information Center,  8 a. m. to 8 p. m. at 800 2139040,  and choose option 6. Media with questions regarding the recall can contact the companys Director of Corporate Communications,  Michael Norton,  at 207 8853132.",

Expands Previously Announced Voluntary Recall of Pet Food Products Due to Potential Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes Health Risks to Humans and Animals - Bravo Packing,  Inc. of Carneys Point,  NJ is expanding the previously announced voluntary recall of two pet food products to now include all pet food and bones in all package sizes. During an FDA inspection,  samples collected tested positive for Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes and resulted in a recall due to the potential health risks to humans and pets. Bravo Packing,  Inc. is expanding the recall due to potential cross contamination. Full list of products below. Salmonella can cause illness in pets eating the products,  as well as people who handle contaminated pet food products,  especially if they have not thoroughly washed their hands after having contact with the products,  infected pets,  or any surfaces exposed to these products. People infected with Salmonella should monitor themselves for some or all of the following symptoms nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea or bloody diarrhea,  abdominal cramping,  and fever. Rarely,  Salmonella can result in more serious ailments,  including arterial infections,  endocarditis an infection of the heart muscle,  arthritis,  muscle pain,  eye irritation,  and urinary tract symptoms. People who have these symptoms after having contact with the products identified in this recall or with a pet that has eaten these products should contact their healthcare providers. A pet with a Salmonella infection may be lethargic and have diarrhea or bloody diarrhea,  fever,  and vomiting. Some pets will have decreased appetite,  fever,  and abdominal pain. If your pet has consumed the recalled products and has these symptoms,  please contact your veterinarian. Pets exposed to contaminated food can be infected without showing symptoms. Infected pets,  including those without symptoms,  can also shed Salmonella through their feces and saliva,  spreading pathogens into the home environment and to humans and other animals nearby. Listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children,  frail or elderly people,  and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only shortterm symptoms such as high fever,  severe headache,  stiffness,  nausea,  abdominal pain,  and diarrhea,  Listeria monocytogenes infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. No human or animal illnesses related to the identified products have been reported to date. Bravo Packing Inc. generally works with distributors that fill orders to retail stores and to consumers directly nationwide. Consumers with any of the affected products should handle them with caution,  discard products in a secure container,  and wash hands and surfaces properly.

Coli O103 Contamination - WASHINGTON,  March 2,  2017 Ohio Farms Packing Co. Ltd. ,  a Creston,  Ohio establishment,  is recalling approximately 40, 680 pounds of boneless veal products that may be contaminated with E. coli O103,  the U. S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. Also included in the recall is an undetermined amount of veal cutlets produced by Ohio Farms Packing Co. Ltd. All of the cutlets were sold to food services;  none of this product was sold directly to consumers. Companies that purchase products from Ohio Farms Packing Co. Ltd. should contact the firm directly to determine whether or not the product they have purchased is subject to the recall. The boneless veal products were produced Nov. 30,  2016 through Feb. 3,  2017. The following products are subject to recallView Label PDF Only 60lb boxes of Atlantic Veal Lamb Inc. Boneless Veal SF with product codes 511012 511020 511021 511023 511024 511030 511032 511034 511336 511337 511340 511341 511343 511351 511362 511365 60lb boxes of Atlantic Veal Lamb LLC Boneless Veal with product codes 507023 507030 507335 507342 507356 507358 The products subject to recall bear establishment number EST. 34569 inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to distributors in Illinois,  Michigan,  North Carolina,  Ohio,  Oklahoma,  Pennsylvania,  Texas and Canada. The problem was discovered when FSIS was notified by the Illinois State Department of Agriculture about a positive non0157 Shiga toxinproducing E. coli sample. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Many clinical laboratories do not test for nonO157 Shiga toxinproducing E. coli STEC,  such as STEC O103 because it is harder to identify than STEC O157. People can become ill from STECs 28 days average of 34 days after consuming the organism. Most people infected with STEC O103 develop diarrhea often bloody,  and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment;  antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended. Most people recover within a week,  but,  rarely,  some develop a more severe infection. Hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS is uncommon with STEC O103 infection. HUS can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old,  older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. It is marked by easy bruising,  pallor,  and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in customers freezers. Customers who have purchased these products are urged not to use them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available,  the retail distribution lists will be posted on the FSIS website atwww. fsis. usda. govrecalls. FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products,  including fresh and frozen,  and only consume ground veal that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 F. The only way to confirm that veal is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature. Safe minimal cooking temperatures can be found at http1. usa. gov1cDxcDQ. Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Shawn Peerless,  COO of Ohio Farms Packing Co.

In pregnant women,  the infection can cause miscarriages,  stillbirths,  premature delivery or lifethreatening infection of the newborn. In addition,  serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higherrisk categories who experience flulike symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS began monitoring a cluster of E. coli O157H7 illnesses on Oct. 29,  2013 then was notified by FDA on Nov. 6,  2013 that California authorities had reported casepatients consuming prepackaged salads with grilled chicken. Working in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC,  FDA,  the California Department of Public Health,  the Washington State Department of Health,  and the Arizona Department of Health Services,  FSIS has determined that there is a link between the grilled chicken salads and the illness cluster. Twentysix casepatients have been identified in three states with indistinguishable E. coli O157H7 PFGE genetic fingerprint patterns with illness onset dates ranging from Sept 29,  2013 to Oct. 26,  2013. Based on epidemiological information,  15 casepatients reported consumption of readytoeat prepackaged salads prior to illness onset. A traceback investigation determined Glass Onion Catering was the supplier of the products implicated in the outbreak. While uncommon to find E. coli O157H7 in a poultry product,  FSIS will continue its investigation in conjunction with the FDA to identify the source of the contamination. FSIS continues to work with the CDC,  FDA and state public health partners on this investigation and will provide updated information as it becomes available. E. coli O157H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration,  bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 28 days 34 days,  on average after exposure the organism. While most people recover within a week,  some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS. This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising,  pallor,  and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. FSIS and the company are concerned that some products may be in a consumers refrigerators. Because this is a readytoeat product,  FSIS advises all consumers to destroy the product.

Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children,  frail or elderly people,  and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever,  diarrhea which may be bloody,  nausea,  vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances,  infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections i. e. ,  infected aneurysms,  endocarditis and arthritis. For more information on Salmonella,  please visit the Center for Disease Control and Preventions website at www. cdc. gov. Rich Ice Cream has received no complaints or reports of illnesses related to our product to date. The recall was initiated after it was determined that the supplier of chocolate peanut clusters used in the product may have used peanuts from PCAs Texas facility. PCA is no longer a supplier for any peanut product or ingredient used at Rich Ice Cream Company. Richs Candy Bar Avalanche is distributed in AL,  CA,  CO,  CT,  FL,  GA,  IL,  IN,  KS,  KY,  LA,  MI,  MO,  NH,  NJ,  NY,  NC,  OH,  OK,  PA,  PR,  SC,  TN,  TX,  VI,  VA,  Barbados and the Bahamas in bulk packages of 12,  and sold to consumers in individual 10 fl. oz. ice cream cups,  with UPC 7545534100 on the individual package. All lots are included in the recall,  including all code dates beginning with a 7 or 8. Because Richs Candy Bar Avalanche is typically consumed at the point of sale,  it is unlikely that consumers will have the product on hand in their homes. However,  if for some reason consumers have the product at home,  they are instructed to dispose of it. For further information,  contact Rich Ice Cream at 5618337585 MF between 730 and 430 EST.",

J. establishment,  is recalling approximately 120, 872 pounds of ground beef products that may be contaminated with E. coli O103,  the U. S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The ground beef products were produced from February 1,  2022,  through April 8,  2022. The complete list of products and product codes for the beef products that are subject to recall can be found here. Labels for the ground beef products can be found here. The products subject to recall bear establishment number EST. 46841 inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations nationwide. The problem was discovered during routine FSIS testing of imported products. There have been no confirmed reports of illness or adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Many clinical laboratories do not test for nonO157 Shiga toxinproducing E. coli STEC such as O103 because it is harder to identify than STEC O157H7. People can become ill from STECs 28 days average of 34 days after consuming the organism. Most people infected with STEC O103 develop diarrhea often bloody and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment;  antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended. Most people recover within a week,  but,  rarely,  some develop a more severe infection. Hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS,  a type of kidney failure,  is uncommon with STEC O103 infection. HUS can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old,  older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. It is marked by easy bruising,  pallor and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately. FSIS is concerned that some products may be in consumers refrigerators or freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS is issuing a public health alert due to concerns that the salad dressing component of readytoeat RTE Caesar salad with chicken may contain egg,  a known allergen,  which is not declared on the finished product label. FSIS is issuing this public health alert to ensure that consumers with an allergy to eggs are aware that these products should not be consumed. A recall was not requested because the products are no longer available for purchase. The Caesar salads with chicken were produced on July 5,  2022. The following products are subject to the public health alert view labels 9 oz. plastic clamshell containers of TRADER JOES CAESAR SALAD WITH WHITE CHICKEN MEAT and Creamy Caesar Dressing with best by dates of 071122 and 071222,  and a lot code of GHNW 18606. The products bear establishment number P46987 inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to Trader Joes locations in Idaho,  Oregon,  and Washington. The problem was discovered when the producing establishment notified FSIS thatthey were informed by a store that the salad dressing packets in the Caesar salad product appeared incorrect. The dressing packets with the salad contain Sweet and Spicy Vinaigrette and not the Creamy Caesar Dressing. These dressing packets are unlabeled and contain egg,  which is not declared on the finished product packaging.

Case labels or packaging may bear the establishment number EST. 4226 or P4226 inside the USDA mark of inspection. The problem was discovered when an FSIS product sample confirmed positive for Listeria monocytogenes Lm. The tested product was held,  and the recalling firm tested raw materials from the product and found that the roasted red skin potatoes,  which were provided by an independent supplier,  tested positive for Lm. The firm is recalling all products that used the confirmed positive potatoes. FSIS and the company have received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of these products. Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis,  a serious infection that primarily affects older adults,  persons with weakened immune systems,  and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly,  persons outside these risk groups are affected. Listeriosis can cause fever,  muscle aches,  headache,  stiff neck,  confusion,  loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women,  the infection can cause miscarriages,  stillbirths,  premature delivery or lifethreatening infection of the newborn. In addition,  serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higherrisk categories who experience flulike symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers freezers. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

Individuals who are highly sensitive to milk protein who consumed caplets from these lots may experience symptoms common to a milk allergy including gastrointestinal issues or allergenic skin reactions. Even in those instances involving more intense reactions,  any anticipated effects are expected to resolve quickly and typically do not require medical treatment. Product was distributed nationwide through AdvoCare and our Independent Distributors. Affected product includes 15, 640 units of Muscle Strength,  Product code P3221 with lot numbers 7063341,  7082161,  and sold between November 15,  2017 March 29,  2018 and 48, 176 units of Nighttime Recovery,  Product code P3201 lot numbers 7081841,  7063321,  7052411,  7090471,  sold between December 15,  2017 March 28,  2018. No reports of adverse events due to a milk allergen had been reported prior to the recall. As part of a routine formula review,  a prospective manufacturer indicated the presence of milk in Ashwagandha,  a raw ingredient common to both Muscle Strength and Nighttime Recovery. After AdvoCare was alerted to the possibility of trace amounts of milk in both products,  we immediately conducted an investigation and engaged a thirdparty health hazard evaluation. The investigation concluded that Ashwagandha was extracted using milk. Therefore,  trace amounts of milk can be detected in these specific lots. The risk of a mild or severe adverse reaction exists but is extremely low i. e. ,  less than 0. 5 of the adult population. AdvoCare suspended sales of Nighttime Recovery and Muscle Strength while issuing the voluntary recall. Communications were sent to all Distributors and Customers who purchased the affected product through the AdvoCare website. Distributors were instructed to contact any customer to whom they sold the product inperson using the sample email communication. If you purchased any of the affected product,  AdvoCare is urging consumers to call Customer Service at 1800 5424800 from 8 a. m. to 8 p. m. Mon Fri for a full refund or exchange of the product.",

Although the consumption of products containing the contaminated sesame seeds does not pose an immediate risk to health,  there may be health issues if there is continued consumption of ethylene oxide over a long period of time. Therefore,  exposure to this pesticide needs to be minimised.",

S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. Recommendations for Preventing Salmonellosis Wash hands with warm,  soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw meat and poultry. Also wash cutting boards,  dishes and utensils with hot soapy water. Clean up spills right away. Keep raw meat,  fish and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat,  poultry and egg products and cooked foods. Cook raw meat and poultry to safe internal temperatures before eating. The safe internal temperature for meat such as ground beef and pork is 160 F,  and 165 F for poultry,  as determined with a food thermometer. Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase one hour if temperatures exceed 90 F. Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking. The following products are subject to recall Labels 10oz. packages of Richards Hog Head Cheese bearing establishment number EST. 2257 inside the USDA mark of inspection and sell by dates Use by 2 1 2013 or Use by 3 20 2013on each package. The products subject to recall were produced on November 1,  2012,  and December 19,  2012. The products were shipped to a distribution center for retail distribution in Louisiana and Southeastern Texas. When available,  the retail distribution lists will be posted on FSIS website at www. fsis. usda. govFSIS_RecallsOpen_Federal_Casesindex. asp. Hog head cheese products produced by EST. 2257 have been linked to a recent Salmonella Uganda cluster involving six casepatients from Louisiana. Working in conjunction with the Louisiana Office of Public Health,  FSIS was able to link illnesses to the RTE pork products produced at this establishment based on epidemiologic and traceback investigations. Illness onset dates among the casepatients ranged from October 16,  2012 to November 10,  2012. Four casepatients confirmed eating the brand under recall. Leftover RTE product from consumers was not available for testing. However,  retail samples of like product from different production dates underwent testing last week,  and four of nine samples tested positive for Salmonella. It is not known at this time if these samples are positive for the outbreak strain,  but any finding of such will be made public by FSIS once it becomes available. FSIS is continuing to work with public health partners on the investigation. Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis,  one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea,  abdominal cramps,  and fever within 12 to 72 hours. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. In some persons,  however,  the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults,  infants,  and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider. Consumers and members of the media who have questions are encouraged to contact Fred Chu,  the companys owner,  at 713 5231751.

The products subject to this recall were further processed by a firm other than Caviness Beef Packers,  EST. 675 and may not bear the establishment number EST. 675,  on products available for direct consumer purchase. These products were shipped to retail locations in Texas. The problem was discovered when FSIS was notified of a USDAs Agricultural Marketing Service AMS sample that tested positive for E. coli 0103. Because the company works with the AMS Commodity Program,  AMS did routine microbiological testing. This shipment of beef was never intended for the National School Lunch Program NLSP and no sales were made to the NLSP. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Many clinical laboratories do not test for nonO157 Shiga toxinproducing E. coli STEC,  such as STEC O103 because it is harder to identify than STEC O157. People can become ill from STECs 28 days average of 34 days after consuming the organism. Most people infected with STEC O103 develop diarrhea often bloody,  and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment;  antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended. Most people recover within a week,  but,  rarely,  some develop a more severe infection. Hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS is uncommon with O103 infection. HUS can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old,  older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. It is marked by easy bruising,  pallor,  and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available,  the retail distribution lists will be posted on the FSIS website atwww. fsis. usda. govrecalls. FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products,  including fresh and frozen,  and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature,  http1. usa. gov1cDxcDQ.

The affected products,  which were manufactured and sold in the eastern United States,  were removed from retail shelves throughout February,  March,  and April 2019. Livestock,  horses,  and poultry exposed to aflatoxin are at risk of exposure to several health hazards. Aflatoxicosis has the same acute and chronic adverse effects and health consequences across all species and age classes immature and mature. Immature animals are more sensitive to aflatoxins. Acute aflatoxicosis may result in generalized hemorrhage,  bloody diarrhea and death in 13 days. In addition,  aflatoxin toxicity can cause reduced feed intake,  reduced weight gain,  liver damage,  jaundice,  and eventually death. No adverse health effects to animals have been reported to date. Nonetheless,  Cargill is taking this voluntary step out of an abundance of caution. The affected products were manufactured at Cargills Cleveland,  North Carolina,  facility. Cargill first learned of the issue when it received a notification from the North Carolina Department of Agriculture of test results showing that a single lot of a specific Southern States product contained elevated levels of aflatoxin. Cargill has identified and corrected the root cause. The following affected products were recalled from retail outlets and distributors in the Georgia,  Maryland,  New Jersey,  New York,  North Carolina,  Pennsylvania,  South Carolina,  Virginia,  and West Virginia markets and removed from retail shelves throughout February,  March,  and April 2019. To view the label for each product,  please click on the link in the table below that corresponds to that product. Consumers and other end users who have any of the affected lots in their possession should return remaining product to their local dealer or retailer for a replacement or full refund. For more information,  call 8008221012 Monday through Friday between 8 a. m. and 430 p. m. Eastern Time. At Cargill,  the safety of our products and the wellbeing of the animals we feed is our top priority. This recall is being conducted with the knowledge of and in cooperation with the United States Food and Drug Administration.",

The products subject to recall bear establishment number EST. 13561 inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to distributors and retail locations nationwide. On October 22,  2018,  FSIS was notified of a cluster of listeriosis illnesses that were closely related. Working in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state public health partners,  FSIS determined that there is a link between the Listeria monocytogenes illnesses and readytoeat pork products produced by Long Phung Foods. The epidemiologic investigation identified a total of four listeriosis confirmed illnesses between July 1,  2017 and October 24,  2018. On November 19,  2018,  whole genome sequencing of investigative samples collected from Long Phung Foods Establishment M13561 showed that the samples were closely related genetically to Listeria monocytogenes from ill people. FSIS is continuing to work with federal and state public health partners to determine if there are additional illnesses linked to these products and will provide updated information should it become available. Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis,  a serious infection that primarily affects older adults,  persons with weakened immune systems,  and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly,  persons outside these risk groups are affected. Listeriosis can cause fever,  muscle aches,  headache,  stiff neck,  confusion,  loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women,  the infection can cause miscarriages,  stillbirths,  premature delivery or lifethreatening infection of the newborn. In addition,  serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higherrisk categories who experience flulike symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food. FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available,  the retail distribution lists will be posted on the FSIS website atwww. fsis. usda. govrecalls.

Sulphur dioxide is water soluble,  and most of it can be removed through washing and cooking. However,  susceptible individuals who are allergic to this preservative may experience breathing difficulties,  headache and nausea after consumption. Action Taken by the Centre for Food Safety The CFS has informed the vendor concerned of the irregularities,  and instructed the vendor to stop sale and remove from shelves the affected batches of the product. The distributor has initiated a recall according to the CFS instructions. The CFS will alert the trade,  continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action. Investigation is ongoing.

S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The ground beef items were produced and packaged on June 21,  2018. The following products are subject to recall Products ListView LabelsPDF only The products subject to recall bear establishment number EST. 86R inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations nationwide. On Aug. 16,  2018,  FSIS was notified of an investigation of E. coli O26 illnesses. FSIS,  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  and state public health and agriculture partners determined that raw ground beef was the probable source of the reported illnesses. The epidemiological investigation identified 17 illnesses and one death with illness onset dates ranging from July 5 to July 25,  2018. The Cargill Meat Solutions ground beef products were identified following further investigation related to Recall 0722018,  conducted on Aug. 30,  2018,  where ground beef products were recalled in connection with the E. coli O26 outbreak. FSIS traceback information indicated that casepatients consumed ground beef products purchased at various retail stores that were supplied by Cargill Meat Solutions. E. coli O26,  like the more common E. coli O157H7,  is a serovar of Shiga toxinproducing E. coli STEC. People can become ill from STECs 28 days average of 34 days after exposure to the organism. Most people infected with STEC O26 develop diarrhea often bloody and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment;  antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended. Most people recover within a week,  but rarely,  some develop a more severe infection. Hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS,  a type of kidney failure,  is common with STEC O26 infection. HUS can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old,  older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. It is marked by easy bruising,  pallor and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available,  the retail distribution lists will be posted on the FSIS website atwww. fsis. usda. govrecalls. FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products,  including fresh and frozen,  and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature,  http1. usa. gov1cDxcDQ. Consumers should take proper precautions when handling raw meat products. Proper hand washing after handling raw meat,  poultry and eggs can greatly reduce the risk of bacterial crosscontamination to other foods and kitchen surfaces. It is important to prevent crosscontamination by washing counter tops and sinks with hot,  soapy water.

In rare circumstances,  infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections i. e. ,  infected aneurysms,  endocarditis and arthritis. If you have symptoms or concerns,  please talk to your doctor. Garden of Life has requested that retailers remove the lots of Raw Meal from sale and that consumers check the lot number on their Raw Meal product and return any products involved in this recall to their point of purchase for a full refund. After extensive testing of the product and its ingredients,  and working in collaboration with the U. S. Food and Drug Administration,  the manufacturer,  suppliers and other thirdparty experts,  the Company has now identified the likely source of Salmonella contamination to be Organic Moringa Leaf powder from a supplier used only in Raw Meal. Because other Garden of Life products containing Moringa use different suppliers,  only Raw Meal is exposed. Following is the list of lots affected added to this recall. Consumers can find the lot codes prominently stamped on the underside of the plastic container. February 12,  2016 Recall Lots No other Garden of Life products are affected by this recall. To prevent a recurrence of this issue,  Garden of Life will remove Organic Moringa powder from Raw Meal and expects new Raw Meal products to be available in stores and through online retailers within the next few weeks. The health of our consumers matters more than anything to every Garden of Life employee,  said Brian Ray,  Garden of Lifes President. We are using this as an opportunity to review our entire sourcing,  manufacturing and distribution system with an eye to making a safe system even better. We will always work to be the industry leader in food safety;  we expect nothing less and know you do as well. You can expect to hear more from us on this topic going forward. On behalf of all of us,  I apologize to everyone affected by this situation. ABOUT RAW MEAL Raw Meal is sold at better health food stores,  natural grocers and online. Consumers who have a Raw Meal product affected by this recall should stop consuming the product and if they wish to return it,  they should return the unused portion of the product to the place of purchase for a full refund.

The products subject to recall bear establishment number EST. 20420 inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations nationwide. The problem was discovered on Oct. 30,  2015,  when a positive result for E. coli O157H7 from FSIS incommerce surveillance program testing was traced back to the establishment. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. E. coli O157H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration,  bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 28 days 34 days,  on average after exposure to the organism. While most people recover within a week,  some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS. This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising,  pallor,  and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available,  the retail distribution lists will be posted on the FSIS website atwww. fsis. usda. govrecalls. FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products,  including fresh and frozen,  and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 F.

Followup is in progress. Product details are as follows Product name Not available in English Place of origin Japan Retailer Not available in English Net weight 0. 5 catty per pack Bestbefore date December 31,  2022 Product name Not available in English Place of origin China Retailer Premier Food Ltd Net weight 450 grams per pack Bestbefore date December 30,  2022 The CFS collected the abovementioned samples from two retail outlets for testing respectively under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The test results showed that the dried mushroom sample and the date sample contained sulphur dioxide at levels of 31 parts per million ppm and 65 ppm,  respectively. Although the levels are within the legal limits,  the functional class and name of the additive were not declared on the food labels,  a CFS spokesman said. The CFS has informed the vendors concerned of the irregularities. According to the CFSs instructions,  the retailers concerned have initiated a recall on the affected batches of the products. Members of the public may call their hotlines at 3188 3141 for dried mushroom2291 6216 for date during office hours for enquiries about the recall of the products concerned. Prosecution will be instituted should there be sufficient evidence,  the spokesman added. Sulphur dioxide is a commonly used preservative in a variety of foods including dried vegetables,  dried fruits,  pickled vegetables and salted fish products. Sulphur dioxide is water soluble,  and most of it can be removed through washing and cooking. However,  susceptible individuals who are allergic to this preservative may experience breathing difficulties,  headaches and nausea after consumption. The spokesman reminded the food trade that the use of preservatives in food must comply with the Preservatives in Food Regulation Cap. 132BD. Furthermore,  the Food and Drugs Composition and Labelling Regulations Cap. 132W require that prepackaged food shall be legibly marked or labelled with a list of ingredients. The regulations also state that for all prepackaged food for sale in Hong Kong containing sulphite in a concentration of 10 ppm or more,  the functional class of the sulphite and its name shall be specified in the list of ingredients. Offenders are liable to a maximum fine of 50, 000 and six months imprisonment upon conviction. The CFS will alert the trade,  continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action. An investigation is ongoing. EndsMonday,  June 28,  2021",

Persons in the higherrisk categories who experience flulike symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food. FSIS is concerned that some product may be in institutions freezers. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

Persons in the higherrisk categories who experience flulike symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

Consumers should stop feeding the products listed below to their dogs. Dogs ingesting elevated levels of Vitamin D may exhibit symptoms such as vomiting,  loss of appetite,  increased thirst,  increased urination,  excessive drooling,  and weight loss. Vitamin D when consumed at very high levels or over a long period of time can lead to serious health issues in dogs including renal dysfunction. Consumers who have dogs that have consumed any of the products listed below and are exhibiting these symptoms,  should contact their veterinarian. Affected Simply Nourish frozen food products were distributed at select PetSmart stores nationwide. Products are packaged in 2lb and 4. 5lb packages across specific date ranges. A full list of affected products is below No illnesses have been reported to date. No other products have been affected. The recall was initiated after a routine nutrition test confirmed elevated Vitamin D levels on certain Simply Nourish frozen food products. Subsequent investigation indicates the problem arose as a result of the vitamin mix dosage being significantly reduced by the vitamin mix manufacturer,  and this change was not detected or properly communicated. As a result,  the dosage was not reduced. We care deeply about our customers and their pets,  and have put corrective actions into place to ensure this issue does not reoccur. This recall is being made with the knowledge of the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. Consumers who have purchased Simply Nourish Frozen Food are urged to return it to the place of purchase for a full refund.

Fuji announced today the voluntary recall of ready to eat sushi,  salads and spring rolls sold to select retailers and distributors along the East Coast and Upper Midwest. The voluntary recall is in response to a notification by the Food and Drug Administration FDA of the potential for product contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. To date,  public health officials have not reported any illness associated with these products. Fuji Food Products is issuing this recall out of an abundance of caution. Listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children,  frail or elderly people and others with weakened immune systems.

The problem was discovered in their Brockton Massachusetts facility by a routine inspection conducted by the FDA. The company has ceased production and distribution of their products in this facility as FDA and the company continue their investigation as to what caused this problem. Fuji Food Products has never before recalled any of its products. As responsible processors of safe,  fresh food for nearly 30 years,  we are addressing this problem vigorously and we apologize to those who are affected by it,  said Fuji Food Products CEO Farrell Hirsch. We will restart operation only after we have eliminated the cause and the FDA certifies that our facility is once again free of possible contamination. The products are packed in plastic trays with clear lids and the sellby dates are on the labels. Consumers who have purchased any of the following products affected by this recall should dispose of the product in an appropriate waste container.

Check to see if you have the recalled products in your home or establishment. Recalled products should be thrown out or returned to the store where they were purchased. Food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes may not look or smell spoiled but can still make you sick. Symptoms can include vomiting,  nausea,  persistent fever,  muscle aches,  severe headache and neck stiffness. Pregnant women,  the elderly and people with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild,  flulike symptoms,  the infection can lead to premature delivery,  infection of the newborn or even stillbirth. In severe cases of illness,  people may die.

The CFIA is conducting a food safety investigation,  which may lead to the recall of other products. If other highrisk products are recalled,  the CFIA will notify the public through updated Food Recall Warnings. The CFIA is verifying that industry is removing the recalled products from the marketplace. Illnesses Imported diced chicken used in these products has been associated with an outbreak investigation,  however,  at this time,  there have been no confirmed illnesses associated with the products identified in this Food Recall Warning.",

Members of the public should not consume the affected product. The trade should also stop using or selling the affected product immediately if they possess it. Product details are as follows Product name Eggs Noodle Thick Brand Sau Tao Place of origin China Net weight 454 grams per pack Sole agent SUN SHUN FUK FOODS CO. ,  LTD. Bestbefore date December 1,  2022 The CFS collected the abovementioned sample from a supermarket in Chai Wan for testing under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The test result showed that the sample contained sulphur dioxide. Although the sulphur dioxide level is below the maximum permitted level under the Preservatives in Food Regulation Cap. 132BD,  the functional class and name of the additive were not declared on the food label of the sample,  a CFS spokesman said. The CFS has informed the vendor concerned and the sole agent of the irregularity,  and instructed them to stop sale and remove from shelves the affected batch of product. The sole agent has initiated a recall according to the CFS instructions. Members of the public may call its hotline at 2461 0190 during office hours for enquiries about the recall,  the spokesman added. Sulphur dioxide is a preservative which can be used in a variety of foods including dried vegetables,  dried fruits,  pickled vegetables and salted fish products. Sulphur dioxide is water soluble,  and most of it can be removed through washing and cooking. However,  susceptible individuals who are allergic to this preservative may experience breathing difficulties,  headache and nausea after consumption. The spokesman reminded the food trade that the use of preservatives in food must comply with the Preservatives in Food Regulation Cap. 132BD. Furthermore,  the Food and Drugs Composition and Labelling Regulations Cap. 132W require that for all prepackaged food for sale in Hong Kong containing sulphite in a concentration of 10 ppm or more,  the functional class of the sulphite and its name shall be specified in the list of ingredients. Offenders are liable to a maximum fine of 50, 000 and six months imprisonment upon conviction. The CFS will alert the trade,  continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action. Investigation is ongoing. EndsTuesday,  October 19,  2021",
