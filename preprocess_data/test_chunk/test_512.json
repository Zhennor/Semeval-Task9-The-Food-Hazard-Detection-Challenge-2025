People who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to milk run the risk of serious or lifethreatening allergic reaction if they consume these products. The affected products were only sold in the USA,  in retail and online. This issue is isolated to two batches of Natreve Vegan Protein Powder French Vanilla Wafer Sundae flavor with the following lot codes The impacted products are stored in 13 oz 10 servings and 1. 47lb 18 servings white tubs and lot codes can be found at the bottom of each tub.

We discovered the issue when one of our retail customers brought to our attention that cups had a UPC code that did not match that for the original fish dip. As a result,  the packaging does not list the presence of a possible egg allergen. Some people who have an extreme allergy or severe sensitivity to egg could run the risk of a serious or life threatening allergic reaction if they consume this product. No illnesses have been reported to date. Smilin Bobs is working with distributors and retailers to quarantine and recover any impacted product remaining on store shelves. A total of 461 cases were distributed to retailers in the states of FL,  GA,  AL,  SC,  TN,  NC,  and VA.

The trade should stop using or selling the affected products immediately if they possess them. Details of the product are as follows 1 Product name Filetti di Acciughe in Olio dOliva con Tartwfo Anchovy Fillets with Truffle in Olive Oil Brand TartufLanghe Place of origin Italy Net weight 90 grams per pack Best before date August 31,  2018 2 Product name Flat Fillets of Anchovies With Capers in Olive Oil Brand ROCCA Place of origin Italy Net weight 100 grams per bottle Best before date July 31,  2019 A CFS spokesman said,  The Centre collected the two abovementioned samples from the citysuper supermarket in Causeway Bay for testing under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The test results showed that the samples contained histamine at levels of 220 milligram mg per 100 gram g and 260mg per 100g respectively. The CFS has informed the vendor concerned of the irregularities. The vendor has removed from shelves and stopped sale of the affected products,  and initiated a recall according to CFS instructions. Members of the public may call the vendors hotline at 2736 3866 during office hours for enquiries about the recall,  the spokesman added. The spokesman said that histamine is commonly found in certain kinds of fish such as tuna,  sardine,  mackerel and anchovy,  as a result of bacterial spoilage. Consumption of fish containing high levels of histamine can cause foodborne intoxication. Symptoms of histamine poisoning include tingling and burning sensation around the mouth,  facial flushing and sweating,  nausea,  vomiting,  headache,  palpitations,  dizziness and rash. The onset of intoxication symptoms is within a few hours after consumption and these symptoms will normally disappear in 12 hours without long term effect,  the spokesman noted. The CFS will alert the trade to the incident and will continue to monitor the case and take appropriate followup action. Investigation is ongoing. EndsMonday,  June 25,  2018",

NYSE KR today announced it has expanded the recall of its 12 oz. packages of Simple Truth Dry Roasted Macadamia Nuts due to potential Listeria monocytogenes contamination. Listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children,  frail or elderly people,  and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only shortterm symptoms such as high fever,  severe headache,  stiffness,  nausea,  abdominal pain and diarrhea,  Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. No customer illnesses have been reported to date. In May,  we were informed by the supplier that the macadamia nuts used in this product may have the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. Routine sampling of a different item produced by the supplier for another company revealed positive Listeria monocytogenes results,  and a subsequent investigation of the manufacturing environment discovered a contaminated piece of equipment. The product comes in a 12 oz. ,  clear plastic package marked with expiration dates of Dec. 09,  2017,  Mar. 02,  2018,  Mar. 03,  2018,  or Apr. 07,  2018 stamped on the side. Product was distributed between 1292016 to 6132017.

The products subject to recall bear establishment number EST. 27316 inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations,  wholesale locations,  and restaurants in Colorado Springs,  Colorado. The problem was discovered on Aug. 5,  2017 when plant management at Good Food Concepts,  LLC notified FSIS inplant inspection personnel that they tested a production lot of carcasses they received from the Callicrate Ranch on July 31,  2017. The carcass trimmings from the N60 analysis was positive for nonO157 STEC serogroup O26. Many clinical laboratories do not test for nonO157 Shiga toxinproducing E. coli STEC,  such as STEC O26 because it is harder to identify than STEC O157. People can become ill from STECs 28 days average of 34 days after consuming the organism. Most people infected with STEC O26 develop diarrhea often bloody,  and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment;  antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended. Most people recover within a week,  but,  rarely,  some develop a more severe infection. Hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS is uncommon with STEC O26 infection. HUS can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old,  older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. It is marked by easy bruising,  pallor,  and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available,  the retail distribution lists will be posted on the FSIS website at www. fsis. usda. govrecalls.",

During production,  FSIS personnel observed precooked rice,  a component of the Boudin,  being held at unsafe temperatures which could result in the products containing an emetic toxin produced by Bacillus cereus. Bacillus cereus is a type of bacteria that can be found in a variety of foods,  particularly rice that has been stored too long at room temperature. Emetic toxins produced by Bacillus cereus are characterized by nausea and vomiting occurring within 30 minutes to six hours after consumption of contaminated foods. FSIS and the company have received no reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact a health care provider. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

The Marks Spencer Strawberry Almond Crunch concerned contains whey powder,  which is declared as an ingredient but Milk has been omitted from the allergy advice box. Although such an allergy advice box is voluntary,  it is strongly recommended that where they are used,  they include all the specified allergens used in the food. In this case,  although nuts,  wheat and gluten are listed,  milk is not,  making this product potentially unsafe for people with a milk allergy.

The CFSs initial investigation showed that the affected batches of the products had been imported to Hong Kong. Product details are as follows Product name HäagenDazs Vanilla Ice Cream Pint Brand HäagenDazs Place of origin France Net volume 473 millilitres Bestbefore date April 13,  2023 Importer General Mills Hong Kong Limited Product name HäagenDazs Vanilla Ice Cream Bulk Brand HäagenDazs Place of origin France Net volume 9. 46 litres Bestbefore date October 26,  2022 Importer General Mills Hong Kong Limited A spokesman for the CFS said,  Upon noticing recent media reports that the two kinds of ice cream were found in Taiwan with a pesticide,  ethylene oxide,  the CFS immediately contacted the local importer and retailers for followup. A preliminary investigation found that the abovementioned importer had imported into Hong Kong the affected batches of the products concerned. Since ethylene oxide is not authorised by the EU,  for the sake of prudence,  the abovementioned importer has stopped sales and removed from shelves the affected batches of the products upon the CFSs instructions and has initiated a recall. Members of the public may call the relevant importer at 2629 6116 during office hours for enquiries about the recall. The spokesman urged the public not to consume the affected batches of the products if they have bought any. The trade should also stop using or selling the affected batches of the products concerned immediately if they possess them. The CFS will alert the trade to the incident,  and will continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action. An investigation is ongoing. EndsTuesday,  June 21,  2022",

Although healthy individuals may suffer only shortterm symptoms such as high fever,  severe headache,  stiffness,  nausea,  abdominal pain and diarrhea,  Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. The recalled broccoli florets were distributed to multiple schools in the Greater Pittsburgh and Butler,  PA areas between 1092017 and 10162017. These customers have all been contacted directly and the affected products were removed on Thursday,  October 19,  2017 when the firm was first notified of the recall by their supplier. The product comes in a 12 cup 1. 7 oz,  clear plastic bag marked with the Just Cut logo on the front with a Best by date of 101617 or 10232017 stamped on the rear. This product was distributed in food service packages only and was not distributed to any retail locations. Mann Packing,  the original supplier of the broccoli florets,  conducted a nationwide recall of various cut vegetables due to a report that the Canadian Food Inspection Agencys random sampling found a single positive result for Listeria monocytogenes on a Mann Packing Power Blend bagged salad product. No other products from Paragon Foods are involved at this time,  and to date,  no illnesses have been reported in connection with this problem. Consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Edd Dwyer,  Food Safety Manager at 7247419139. Phones will be monitored 7 days per week. Members of the media with questions regarding the recall can contact John McClelland,  Chief Operating Officer,  at 724 7419156.",

Smith and Sons Meat Packing,  a Draper,  Utah establishment,  is recalling approximately 38, 200 pounds of beef products that may be contaminated with E. coli O157H7,  the U. S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The following products are subject to recallVarious weight combo bins of Boneless Beef 5050,  8515,  9010,  9307 or 9505 produced on Aug. 7,  2012. Various weight boxes of primal cuts,  subprimal cuts and boxed beef produced on Aug. 7,  2012. PREPARING GROUND BEEF FOR SAFE CONSUMPTION Wash hands before and after handling raw meat with warmhot preferred or cold soapy running water by rubbing hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds. Also wash cutting boards,  dishes and utensils with hot preferred,  soapy water and clean up any spills right away. The mechanical action of vigorous rubbing of hands and utensilssurfaces creates friction that helps to dislodge bacteria and viruses from hands and surfaces. Additionally,  warmhot water helps to dissolve fatsfoods,  aiding in cleaningmicrobe removal and can also assist in deactivation of pathogens. For more information on hand washing,  go to httpwww. cdc. gov handwashing . If soapy water is not available,  use an alcoholbased hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 alcohol. Alcoholbased hand sanitizers can reduce the number of germs on hands in some situations. However,  sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs,  including viruses. Keep raw meat,  fish and poultry away from other food that will not be thoroughly cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat,  poultry,  and their juices and thoroughly cooked foods. Thoroughly cook ground meat such as beef to an internal temperature of 160 F,  as measured with a food thermometer,  before eating. Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase one hour if temperatures exceed 90 F. Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking. Each box bears a label with the identifying package date of 08072012 as well as the establishment number EST. 4975 inside the USDA mark of inspection. The products subject to recall were distributed to wholesale and retail establishments in California and Salt Lake City,  Utah.

Coli O157:H7 Contamination - fsis. usda. govFSIS_RecallsOpen_Federal_Casesindex. asp. The problem was discovered through lab testing conducted by USDAs Agricultural Marketing Service,  which confirmed positive results for E. coli O157H7,  and may have occurred as a result of a refrigeration malfunction. The company is recalling all beef products produced on Aug. 7,  2012,  because of a strong potential for cross contamination during production. FSIS and the company have received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of these products. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact a healthcare provider. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and to ensure that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. E. coli O157H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause bloody diarrhea,  dehydration,  and in the most severe cases,  kidney failure. The very young,  seniors and persons with weak immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness. FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products,  including fresh and frozen,  and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature. Consumers and media with questions regarding the recall should contact the companys Plant Manager,  Mike Smith,  at 801 5713611.",

In some cases,  a Food Alert for Action is issued. This provides local authorities with details of specific action to be taken on behalf of consumers. Ref FSAPRIN202020 Subscribe to news and alerts",

People who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to milk run the risk of serious or lifethreatening allergic reaction if they consume this product. Product was initially distributed to the following states and the list will be updated as information becomes available CA,  CT,  FL,  IA,  IL,  MA,  MD,  ME,  MI,  NC,  NH,  NJ,  NY,  OH,  PA,  SC,  VA,  WI. The yogurts are sold at natural food stores and grocery retailers nationwide. The specific product being recalled comes in 5. 3 ounce cups and has the code date of November 4,  2017 on the lid and carrying the following product code printed along the side of the cup OSoy Strawberry UPC Code052159 006037. Consumers who may have purchased the potentially affected OSoy Strawberry soy yogurts with this code date are asked to immediately dispose of them. Stonyfield is advising their distribution network to immediately remove these specific codedated yogurts from retail shelves. The recall is due to the possibility that some product shipped from its Londonderry plant may contain dairy yogurt instead of soy yogurt as labeled. The issue was identified after receiving two consumer complaints. No injuries or illnesses have been reported to date. Although the company believes the problem is not widespread,  it is taking this measure to ensure the safety of its consumers. Our first priority has always been and will always be the health and wellbeing of our consumers,  says Esteve Torrens,  Stonyfield CEYo. While we continue to investigate this issue we believe recalling all potentially affected cups is the most responsible and transparent choice at this time.

In some cases,  a Food Alert for Action is issued. This provides local authorities with details of specific action to be taken on behalf of consumers. Ref FSAPRIN512019 Subscribe to news and alerts",

Upon learning of the incident and according to the information provided by the Taiwanese authorities,  the CFS immediately contacted local importers for followup.

Since ethylene oxide is not authorised by the European Union,  for the sake of prudence,  the abovementioned importer has stopped selling and removed from shelves the affected batch of the product upon the CFSs instructions and has initiated a recall. Members of the public may call the importers hotline at 2947 7038 during office hours for enquiries about the recall. The spokesman urged the public not to consume the affected batch of the product if they have bought any.

The trade should also stop using or selling the affected product immediately if they possess it. Product details are as follows Product name Organic Ginger Powder Brand SpiceBox Place of origin India Distributor SpiceBox Organics Limited Net weight 50 grams per pack Bestbefore date March 30,  2019 A spokesman for the CFS said,  The CFS collected the abovementioned sample from a shop in the Midlevels for testing under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The results showed that it contained aflatoxins at a level of 20 micrograms µg per kilogram. Under the Harmful Substances in Food Regulation Cap 132 AF,  the maximum permitted concentration for aflatoxins in food except for peanuts or peanut products is 15µgkg. The spokesman said,  The CFS has informed the vendor concerned of the irregularity and the vendor has removed from shelves and stopped sale of the affected product according to the CFS instructions. Should there be sufficient evidence,  prosecution will be instituted. The Centre is also tracing the source and distribution of the affected product. The World Health Organization WHOs International Agency for Research on Cancer classified naturally occurring aflatoxins as carcinogenic to humans,  and the Joint Food and Agriculture OrganizationWHO Expert Committee on Food Additives advised that intake of aflatoxins should be reduced to levels as low as reasonably possible although no healthbased guidance value has been set. Aflatoxins can lead to liver cancer after longterm ingestion,  and the risk for hepatitis B carriers is relatively high. The spokesman urged members of the public who had bought the affected batch of the product to stop consuming it. To avoid excessive intake of mycotoxins,  people should maintain a balanced and varied diet to minimise the risk from a small range of food items,  and to avoid consuming food that looks mouldy or damaged. The CFS will alert the trade,  continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action. Investigation is ongoing. EndsThursday,  July 5,  2018",

Announces a Voluntary Recall on Select Golden Temple®, Swad®, and Maya® Flour Products in the U.S. Due to Possible E. Coli 0121 Contamination - Markham,  ON Canada In collaboration with the U. S. Food and Drug Administration FDA,  Smucker Foods of Canada Corp. today announced a voluntary recall on specific production codes of Golden Temple,  Swad,  and Maya flour products in the U. S. due to possible E. coli 0121 contamination. The impacted product was produced by Ardent Mills located in Saskatoon,  SK Canada. Additional flour and flour products have been voluntarily recalled in Canada in cooperation with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency as part of their ongoing E. Coli investigation. No other Smucker Foods of Canada Corp. products distributed in the U. S. are affected by this recall. Impacted product is packaged in 20 lb. paper bags and was distributed nationwide to 19 distributors and two small retailers.

HUS is most likely to occur in young children and the elderly and those with compromised immune systems. The condition can lead to serious kidney failure and even death. Any consumers concerned about an illness should contact a physician. There are no reported illnesses to date associated with the U. S. product recall.

Less commonly,  persons outside these risk groups are affected. Listeriosis can cause fever,  muscle aches,  headache,  stiff neck,  confusion,  loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms.",

The test result showed that the sample contained sorbic acid at a level of 69 parts per million ppm and sulphur dioxide at a level of 41 ppm. Although the levels are within the legal limits,  the functional class and names of the two additives were not declared on the food label of the sample. Sulphur dioxide is a commonly used preservative in a variety of foods including dried vegetables,  dried fruits,  pickled vegetables and salted fish products. Sulphur dioxide is water soluble,  and most of it can be removed through washing and cooking. However,  susceptible individuals who are allergic to this preservative may experience breathing difficulties,  headaches and nausea after consumption. Action Taken by the Centre for Food Safety The CFS has informed the vendor concerned of the irregularity. The distributor concerned has initiated a recall on the affected batch of the product according to the CFSs instructions. The CFS will alert the trade,  continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action. Investigation is ongoing. Advice to the Trade Stop using or selling the affected batch of the product immediately if they possess it. Advice to Consumers Should not consume the affected batch of the product. Further Information The CFS press release Members of the public may call its hotline at 2291 6216 during office hours for enquiries about the recall.

Consumption of food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes can cause listeriosis,  an uncommon but potentially fatal disease. Healthy people rarely contract listeriosis. However,  listeriosis can cause high fever,  severe headache,  neck stiffness and nausea. Listeriosis can also cause miscarriages and stillbirths,  as well as serious and sometimes fatal infections in those with weakened immune systems,  such as infants,  the elderly and persons with HIV infection or undergoing chemotherapy. If any of the described symptoms are exhibited,  customers are urged to seek medical attention.",
