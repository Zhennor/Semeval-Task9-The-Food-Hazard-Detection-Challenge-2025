6482,2022,7,3,us,Natreve Issues Voluntary Recall on Limited U.S. Batches of Natreve Vegan Protein Powder French Vanilla Wafer Sundae Flavor Due to Undeclared Milk,"Natreve, a mission-driven and ocean-forward premium wellness company, is voluntarily recalling specific batches of its Vegan Protein Powder French Vanilla Wafer Sundae flavor, because it contains trace amounts of undeclared milk due to an external manufacturing production error. People who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to milk run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume these products. The affected products were only sold in the USA, in retail and online. This issue is isolated to two batches of Natreve Vegan Protein Powder French Vanilla Wafer Sundae flavor with the following lot codes: The impacted products are stored in 13 oz (10 servings) and 1.47lb (18 servings) white tubs and lot codes can be found at the bottom of each tub. The issue was identified as a result of one illness having been reported to date. An investigation was conducted by the contract manufacturer indicating the problem was caused by a production process error for these two impacted lots. No Canadian products nor other products or lots within the U.S. Natreve product offering are impacted by this voluntary recall. A whey-derived flavoring ingredient was inadvertently used in the blend for Natreve Vegan Protein Powder French Vanilla Wafer Sundae flavor, leading to trace amounts of whey being found in the above batches. Whey is derived from milk and may trigger an allergy, posing a potential risk to people with milk allergies. Consumers who purchased Natreve Vegan Protein Powder French Vanilla Wafer Sundae flavor, with Lot Code 46359 or 46360 should discard this product if they are allergic or highly sensitive to dairy. Refunds are available and will be provided at the point of sale through validation of lot codes on affected tubs by bringing them in store. Those who purchased through www.natreve.com can also email quality@natreve.com to request a refund.  Consumers with questions may contact the company at quality@natreve.com or send a direct message to @natrevewellness on Instagram.

The trade should stop using or selling the affected products immediately if they possess them. Details of the product are as follows:  (1) Product name: Filetti di Acciughe in Olio d’Oliva con Tartwfo (Anchovy Fillets with Truffle in Olive Oil)  Brand: TartufLanghe  Place of origin: Italy  Net weight: 90 grams per pack  Best before date: August 31, 2018  (2) Product name: Flat Fillets of Anchovies With Capers in Olive Oil  Brand: ROCCA  Place of origin: Italy  Net weight: 100 grams per bottle  Best before date: July 31, 2019 A CFS spokesman said, ""The Centre collected the two abovementioned samples from the city'super supermarket in Causeway Bay for testing under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The test results showed that the samples contained histamine at levels of 220 milligram (mg) per 100 gram (g) and 260mg per 100g respectively."" ""The CFS has informed the vendor concerned of the irregularities. The vendor has removed from shelves and stopped sale of the affected products, and initiated a recall according to CFS' instructions. Members of the public may call the vendor's hotline at 2736 3866 during office hours for enquiries about the recall,"" the spokesman added.  The spokesman said that histamine is commonly found in certain kinds of fish such as tuna, sardine, mackerel and anchovy, as a result of bacterial spoilage. Consumption of fish containing high levels of histamine can cause foodborne intoxication. Symptoms of histamine poisoning include tingling and burning sensation around the mouth, facial flushing and sweating, nausea, vomiting, headache, palpitations, dizziness and rash. The onset of intoxication symptoms is within a few hours after consumption and these symptoms will normally disappear in 12 hours without long term effect, the spokesman noted. The CFS will alert the trade to the incident and will continue to  monitor the case and take appropriate follow-up action.

2809,2017,6,15,na,Kroger Expands Recall of 12 oz. packages of Simple Truth Dry Roasted Macadamia Nuts because of Possible Health Risk,"The Kroger Co. (NYSE: KR) today announced it has expanded the recall of its 12 oz. packages of Simple Truth Dry Roasted Macadamia Nuts due to potential Listeria monocytogenes contamination.  Listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.  No customer illnesses have been reported to date.
In May, we were informed by the supplier that the macadamia nuts used in this product may have the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. Routine sampling of a different item produced by the supplier for another company revealed positive Listeria monocytogenes results, and a subsequent investigation of the manufacturing environment discovered a contaminated piece of equipment.   The product comes in a 12 oz., clear plastic package marked with expiration dates of:  Dec. 09, 2017, Mar. 02, 2018, Mar. 03, 2018, or Apr. 07, 2018 stamped on the side. Product was distributed between 12/9/2016 to 6/13/2017.  Kroger has removed the following item from store shelves and initiated its customer recall notification system that alerts customers who may have purchased recalled products through register receipt tape messages and phone calls.   
Kroger has expanded this recall to include all stores nationwide under the following names: Kroger, Ralphs, Food 4 Less, Foods Co., Fred Meyer, Fry's, King Soopers, City Market, Smith's, Dillons, Baker's, Gerbes, Jay C, Ruler Foods, Pay Less, Pick ‘N Save, Copps, Metro Market, Owen's and QFC.
Customers who have purchased any of the products described above should not consume them and should return them to a store for a full refund or replacement.

People who have an allergy to eggs and/or wheat run the risk of a serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume this product.

The product comes in a 15 ounce can marked with code P642 M1217 70026 on the bottom. No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem. The recall was initiated after it was discovered that the cans labeled as Southgate Hot Dog Sauce contain Chicken and Dumplings that have wheat and egg which are allergens not listed on the label.

FSIS was notified of an investigation of E. coli O157:H7 illnesses on September 16, 2016. Working in conjunction with the Connecticut Department of Public Health, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, FSIS determined that there is a link between beef from Adams Farm Slaughterhouse and this illness cluster. Based on the epidemiological investigation, 7 case-patients have been identified in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia with illness onset dates ranging from June 27, 2016 to September 4, 2016. Traceback information was available for 5 case-patients and indicated that all 5 case-patients consumed beef products supplied by Adams Farms Slaughterhouse. FSIS continues to work with public health partners on this investigation and will provide updated information as it becomes available.

E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2–8 days (3–4 days, on average) after exposure the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume beef and ground meat that has been cooked to a temperature of 145° F for beef (with a three minute rest time) and 160° F for ground meat. The only way to confirm that your meat products have been cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

Issues Allergy Alert On Undeclared Soy And Milk In “Brinkman's Gourmet Barbecue Sauce”.,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - December 10, 2010 - Brinkman Turkey Farms Inc. of Findlay, Ohio is recalling the following product from distribution: Brinkman’s Gourmet Barbecue Sauce in 22 oz. glass jars UPC# 033244000215, 40 oz. glass jars UPC# 033244000222, and 160 oz. plastic jugs UPC# 033244000208. This product is subject to recall because it contains the undeclared ingredients, milk and soy. People who have allergies to milk and soy run the risk of serious or life threatening allergic reactions if they consume these products.
The recalled Brinkman’s Gourmet Barbecue Sauce products were distributed to retail stores and distribution centers in Ohio and direct to consumers in Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, and Iowa. The product comes in 22 oz. and 40 oz. glass jars and a 160 oz. plastic jug.
No illness has been reported to date in connection with this problem.
The recall was initiated after it was discovered that the product containing milk and soy was distributed in packaging that did not reveal the presence of milk and soy in its contents.
Subsequent investigation indicates the problem was caused by temporary breakdown in the company’s packaging process.
Production of the product has been suspended until the FDA and the company are certain the problem has been corrected.
Consumers who have purchased 22 oz., 40 oz., or 160 oz. Brinkman’s Gourmet Barbecue Sauce are urged to return them to the place of purchase for full refund. Consumers with questions may contact the company at 419-365-5127 Monday through Friday 8 am to 5 pm eastern standard time.

1016,2010,3,10,us,2010 - Quaker Snack Mix Baked Cheddar Voluntarily Recalled Due to Possible Health Risk,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - March 10, 2010 - PLANO, TX – Quaker Snack Mix Baked Cheddar is being voluntary recalled after Basic Food Flavors, Inc. of Las Vegas, Nevada initiated a recall of their hydrolyzed vegetable protein (HVP) due to potential Salmonella contamination.

Issues Allergy Alert on Undeclared Cashew Allergen in Dry Roasted Almonds","Specialty Commodities, Inc., (SCI) of Fargo, N.D., a subsidiary of Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM), is recalling a specific lot of dry roasted almonds because they may contain undeclared cashews. People who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to cashews run the risk of a serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume these products. The recalled dry roasted almonds were distributed to six customers in Arizona, California and Colorado. They were shipped in 25 lb. cartons, marked with lot #1050188-1-16007 on the side of the cardboard cartons. The cartons were distributed to other food production companies for further processing and packaging—they are not distributed directly to consumers for sale in retail outlets. The recalled dry roasted almonds were distributed between January 26, 2016 and February 16, 2016. No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem. The recall was initiated after it was discovered that the cashew-containing product was distributed in packaging that did not reveal the presence of cashews. Subsequent investigation indicates the problem was caused by a temporary process breakdown by a third-party, contract manufacturer that processed and packaged the almonds for SCI. The dry roasted almonds were inadvertently mixed with cashews before being forwarded to impacted customers. Representatives of SCI have notified these customers of the recall and provided return instructions. Please direct any customer inquiries to 701-282-8222 between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Central Time Monday through Friday.  ",allergens,"nuts, nut products and seeds",cashew,almonds

3673,2018,10,19,us,Envolve Foods Recalls Chicken and Beef Products due to Possible Salmonella and Listeria Monocytogenes Contamination in Vegetables,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 19, 2018 – Envolve Foods, a Corona, Calif. establishment, is recalling approximately 292,764 pounds of ready-to-eat chicken and beef products that contain a vegetable ingredient that may be contaminated with Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.
The ready-to-eat chicken and beef items were produced and packaged from Feb. 2, 2017 through Oct. 12, 2018. The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF only)]

• 22-oz. plastic bags containing “simple truth, Chicken Bibimbap” and a case code number of 011110890108 on the label and use by/sell by dates of 11/2/18 through 3/12/20.

• 22-oz. plastic bags containing “simple truth, Chicken Tikka Masala” and a case code of 011110890092 on the label and use by/sell by dates of 3/22/19 through 4/12/19.

• 10-lb. cases containing “CADENCE GOURMET, Steak Fajitas,” with an item number of SS00024, and an expiration dates of 11/1/2018 through 01/18/19, on the label.
• 10-lb. cases containing “CADENCE GOURMET, Tuscan Tomato Basil Chicken & Sausage,” with an item number of SS00032, and an expiration dates of 10/20/18 through 01/09/19 on the label.

• 10-lb. cases containing “CADENCE GOURMET, Rustic Toasted Tomato Basil Chicken & Vegetables,” with an item number of SS00047, and an expiration dates of 2/05/19 through 10/12/19 on the label.
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 44857” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to distribution warehouses nationwide.

The problem was discovered on October 16, 2018 when Envolve Foods received notification that the vegetables used in the production of their ready-to-eat products were being recalled by their vegetable supplier due to Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes concerns.

There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider. 
Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers’ freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.
FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

Media with questions regarding the recall can contact Montey Dunn, director of marketing for Envolve Foods, at (818) 200-9450. Consumers with questions regarding the recall can the company’s customer service hotline at 1-877-244-0947.

The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 27316” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations, wholesale locations, and restaurants in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

The problem was discovered on Aug. 5, 2017 when plant management at Good Food Concepts, LLC notified FSIS in-plant inspection personnel that they tested a production lot of carcasses they received from the Callicrate Ranch on July 31, 2017. The carcass trimmings from the N60 analysis was positive for non-O157 STEC serogroup O26.

Many clinical laboratories do not test for non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), such as STEC O26 because it is harder to identify than STEC O157. People can become ill from STECs 2–8 days (average of 3–4 days) after consuming the organism. Most people infected with STEC O26 develop diarrhea (often bloody), and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment; antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended.

Most people recover within a week, but, rarely, some develop a more severe infection. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is uncommon with STEC O26 infection. HUS can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old, older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

1-888-MPHOTLINE or visit www.fsis.usda.gov

Wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw meat and poultry. Wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot, soapy water. Immediately clean spills.

Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry and egg products and cooked foods.

Color is NOT a reliable indicator that meat has been cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria.

The only way to be sure the meat or poultry is cooked to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use a thermometer to measure the internal temperature.

Fish: 145°F

Beef, pork, lamb chops/steaks/roasts: 145°F with a three minute rest time

Ground meat: 160°F

Poultry: 165°F

1665,2014,10,30,us,Texas Firm Recalls Boudin Products Due To Possible Temperature Abuse,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 30, 2014 – Carlton Foods, a New Braunfels, Texas establishment, is recalling approximately 25,764 pounds of fresh Boudin products, which were produced with pre-cooked rice that may have experienced temperature abuse and may contain an emetic toxin produced by Bacillus cereus, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The Boudin (sausage-like) products were produced on Aug. 22, 2014, through Oct. 17, 2014. The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF Only)]

12-oz. vacuum-packed packages of “RICHARD’S HICKORY SMOKED BOUDIN”

12-oz. vacuum-packed packages of “RICHARD’S ‘HOT’ PREMIUM BOUDIN”

16-oz. vacuum-packed packages of “RICHARD’S PREMIUM BOUDIN”

32-oz. vacuum-packed packages of “RICHARD’S CAJUN GRILLERS BOUDIN”
The products subject to recall bear the establishment number “EST. 1943” or “EST. 961” inside the USDA mark of inspection. Products with the EST. 961 inside the mark of inspection would also have NB printed on the label. “Sell By” dates for the recalled products range from Oct. 28, 2014, to Dec. 16, 2014. The products were shipped to retail locations in Louisiana and Texas.

The problem was discovered by FSIS personnel during a Food Safety Assessment. During production, FSIS personnel observed pre-cooked rice, a component of the Boudin, being held at unsafe temperatures which could result in the products containing an emetic toxin produced by Bacillus cereus.

Bacillus cereus is a type of bacteria that can be found in a variety of foods, particularly rice that has been stored too long at room temperature. Emetic toxins produced by Bacillus cereus are characterized by nausea and vomiting occurring within 30 minutes to six hours after consumption of contaminated foods.

FSIS and the company have received no reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact a health care provider.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

6455,2022,6,21,hk,CFS urges public not to consume two kinds of ice cream from France with possible presence of ethylene oxide,"CFS urges public not to consume two kinds of ice cream from France with possible presence of ethylene oxide The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department said today (June 21) that the CFS is actively following up on media reports that two kinds of ice cream from France were found in Taiwan with a pesticide, ethylene oxide, which is not authorised by the European Union (EU). The CFS's initial investigation showed that the affected batches of the products had been imported to Hong Kong. Product details are as follows: Product name: Häagen-Dazs Vanilla Ice Cream Pint Brand: Häagen-Dazs Place of origin: France Net volume: 473 millilitres Best-before date: April 13, 2023 Importer: General Mills Hong Kong Limited Product name: Häagen-Dazs Vanilla Ice Cream Bulk Brand: Häagen-Dazs Place of origin: France Net volume: 9.46 litres Best-before date: October 26, 2022 Importer: General Mills Hong Kong Limited A spokesman for the CFS said, ""Upon noticing recent media reports that the two kinds of ice cream were found in Taiwan with a pesticide, ethylene oxide, the CFS immediately contacted the local importer and retailers for follow-up. A preliminary investigation found that the above-mentioned importer had imported into Hong Kong the affected batches of the products concerned."" Since ethylene oxide is not authorised by the EU, for the sake of prudence, the above-mentioned importer has stopped sales and removed from shelves the affected batches of the products upon the CFS's instructions and has initiated a recall. Members of the public may call the relevant importer at 2629 6116 during office hours for enquiries about the recall. The spokesman urged the public not to consume the affected batches of the products if they have bought any. The trade should also stop using or selling the affected batches of the products concerned immediately if they possess them. The CFS will alert the trade to the incident, and will continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action. An investigation is ongoing.   Ends/Tuesday, June 21, 2022",chemical,ices and desserts,unauthorised substance ethylene oxide,ice cream

No illnesses have been reported to date.
Listeria monocytogenes is an organism, which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although, healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms, such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Listeria monocytogenes infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.
The recall is being conducted in response to additional environmental testing following the initial investigation. There were no positive findings in any food products or on food contact surfaces. IFS initiated a thorough cleaning and disinfection process, followed by extensive testing, and also has engaged outside food safety experts to review the company’s processes and policies. The company is working closely with FDA officials and has voluntarily expanded the recall to include products produced between 5/18/16 and 6/16/16. The products were distributed to foodservice distributors in eight States. No retail products are affected by this recall.
The schools and foodservice distributors were located in the following states: CA, MI, NC, NM, OH, PA, TX, VA, WA. On the IFS website, customers will find a list of school districts that received the products being recalled. The list will be updated daily as further information becomes available.
The company is thoroughly communicating the details of the recall and is notifying customers and distributors to hold any product that may be in frozen storage until arrangements can be made to return or destroy the product. IFS will work closely with schools and school foodservice distributors until the company can assure that no recalled product remains in their locations.
Any school district that believes it may have product still in frozen storage that is affected by this recall should contact the IFS recall coordinator at (800) 560-9999 between the hours of 8AM and 5PM Pacific time, Monday through Friday, or at recall@integratedfoodservice.com for return or disposal instructions.
As a third-generation, family-owned company, IFS takes its responsibility to provide safe, nutritious foods for all its customers very seriously, particularly the foods produced for children in schools.

The “Regular Ends Precooked Bacon” items were produced on September 22, 2016. The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF only)]

17 CASES of 2-5 lbs. PACKAGES IN CARDBOARD BOXES, CONTAINING “48108 REGULAR ENDS PRECOOKED BACON NET WT. 10 lbs. 2/5 lbs.” with a packaging date of “9/22/16” and use by date of “6/19/17.
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 6133” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to Associated Foods retail locations in Idaho and Utah.

The problem was discovered during the company’s routine internal third party testing when a product sample collected tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes (Lm). There have been no confirmed reports of illness or adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.

Consumption of food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to reheat ready-to-eat product until steaming hot.

Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.
The recalled broccoli florets were distributed to multiple schools in the Greater Pittsburgh and Butler, PA areas between 10/9/2017 and 10/16/2017. These customers have all been contacted directly and the affected products were removed on Thursday, October 19, 2017 when the firm was first notified of the recall by their supplier.
The product comes in a 1/2 cup (1.7 oz), clear plastic bag marked with the ""Just Cut"" logo on the front with a Best by date of 10/16/17 or 10/23/2017 stamped on the rear. This product was distributed in food service packages only and was not distributed to any retail locations.
Mann Packing, the original supplier of the broccoli florets, conducted a nationwide recall of various cut vegetables due to a report that the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's random sampling found a single positive result for Listeria monocytogenes on a Mann Packing Power Blend bagged salad product.
No other products from Paragon Foods are involved at this time, and to date, no illnesses have been reported in connection with this problem.

2566,2016,12,16,us,"Houdini Inc. Recalls Blue Cheese Savory Twists, 7 Oz Box Because of Possible Health Risk","Houdini Inc. of Fullerton, California is recalling limited quantities of Blue Cheese Savory Twists, 7 oz box after the FDA found traces of Salmonella at the manufacturing facility of the ingredient supplier for the powdered buttermilk used to make the Blue Cheese seasoning in these products.  Although no pathogenic bacteria have been found in the powdered products supplied to our Savory Twist supplier by the ingredient manufacturer, nor in any of the Blue Cheese Savory Twists themselves, we have decided out of an abundance of caution to recall products produced from the specific lots purchased from this ingredient supplier.
Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
A limited quantity of products was distributed nationwide to consumers through Houdini Inc.’s direct to consumer division Wine Country Gift Baskets (catalog / internet) and Houdini Inc’s wholesale division.
Affected product includes the following details:
Houdini Inc. is committed to providing only the highest quality of product and is taking this action out of an abundance of caution in interest of consumer protection.
This recall only affects the 7oz Blue Cheese Savory Twist in gift baskets shipped or sold in stores from September 1, 2016 to December 12, 2016. There is no issue with any of the other food products in the gift basket.
Houdini Inc. has not experienced any problems or complaints about this product. To date, no injuries or illnesses have been reported. If you have any 7 oz Blue Cheese Savory Twists remaining, please discard them; do not consume. If you gave the product to someone, please let them know to discard the product. This is a voluntary recall as a precautionary measure. This voluntary recall is being conducted with the knowledge of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

    MSI Express Inc. Recalls Unilever Food Solutions U.S. Knorr Curry Chicken and Rice Soup Mix Products Due to Misbranding and Undeclared Allergen
  
  FSIS Announcement
  
  
  
            WASHINGTON, July 20, 2022 – MSI Express Inc., a Grand Prairie, Texas establishment, is recalling approximately 16,498 pounds of chicken and rice soup mix products, due to misbranding and undeclared allergen, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. The product contains milk, a known allergen, which is not declared on the product label.
The not heat treated, shelf stable, Thai-style curry chicken with rice soup mix items were produced on January 19, 2022, and January 31, 2022. The following products are subject to recall [view labels]:
1.29-lb. (583 g) plastic pouch packages containing “KNORR PROFESSIONAL SOUP du jour RED THAI STYLE CURRY CHICKEN WITH RICE SOUP MIX” with “best by” dates of January 19, 2024, for products distributed in the United States, and April 26, 2023, for products distributed in Canada.
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “P- 44055” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were distributed in the United States and Canada to professional food service trades, such as restaurants, cafeterias, fast food chains, and sports stadiums, as well as through online sales.                
The problem was discovered when the establishment notified FSIS that it performed allergen testing validation on finished soup. It was determined that the finished soup tested positive for dairy, an allergen that was not declared on the product label, due to the establishment receiving the incorrect ingredient component.
There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.
FSIS is concerned that some product may in the pantries of consumers, restaurants, and food service locations. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them and restaurants are urged not to serve these products. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.
FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution lists will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

2206,2016,5,6,us,Wheatberry Salad,"Publix Super Markets Inc. is issuing a voluntary recall for Wheatberry Salad. The product is available in plastic containers available in the Publix Delis. The sunflower kernels used in the salad are involved with the larger nationwide recall due to Listeria monocytogenes.
The Wheatberry Salad was available in all Publix retail locations in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Consumption of products containing Listeria monocytogenes can cause serious and sometimes fatal infection in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.
“While the product is no longer available on store shelves, we have issued a voluntary recall because of our commitment to food safety and to advise our customers who may still have this product at home,” said Maria Brous, Publix media and community relations director. “No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with the Wheatberry Salad.

1244,2012,8,14,us,Utah Firm Recalls Beef Products Due To Possible E. Coli O157:H7 Contamination,"WASHINGTON, August 14, 2012 - Dale T. Smith and Sons Meat Packing, a Draper, Utah establishment, is recalling approximately 38,200 pounds of beef products that may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.
The following products are subject to recall:Various weight combo bins of Boneless Beef ""50/50,"" ""85/15,"" ""90/10,"" ""93/07"" or ""95/05"" produced on Aug. 7, 2012.

Various weight boxes of primal cuts, subprimal cuts and boxed beef produced on Aug. 7, 2012.




PREPARING GROUND BEEF FOR SAFE CONSUMPTION


Wash hands before and after handling raw meat with warm/hot (preferred) or cold soapy running water by rubbing hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds. Also wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot (preferred), soapy water and clean up any spills right away. The mechanical action of vigorous rubbing of hands and utensils/surfaces creates friction that helps to dislodge bacteria and viruses from hands and surfaces.
Additionally, warm/hot water helps to dissolve fats/foods, aiding in cleaning/microbe removal and can also assist in deactivation of pathogens. For more information on hand washing, go to http://www.cdc.gov/
handwashing . If soapy water is not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can reduce the number of germs on hands in some situations. However, sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs, including viruses.
Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be thoroughly cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry, and their juices and thoroughly cooked foods. Thoroughly cook ground meat such as beef to an internal temperature of 160° F, as measured with a food thermometer, before eating. Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase (one hour if temperatures exceed 90° F). Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.





Each box bears a label with the identifying package date of ""08/07/2012"" as well as the establishment number ""EST. 4975"" inside the USDA mark of inspection. The products subject to recall were distributed to wholesale and retail establishments in California and Salt Lake City, Utah. It is important to note that the products were destined for further processing and may not bear ""EST. 4975"" on the products available for direct consumer purchase. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on FSIS' website at www.fsis.usda.gov/FSIS_Recalls/Open_Federal_Cases/index.asp.
The problem was discovered through lab testing conducted by USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service, which confirmed positive results for E. coli O157:H7, and may have occurred as a result of a refrigeration malfunction. The company is recalling all beef products produced on Aug. 7, 2012, because of a strong potential for cross contamination during production. FSIS and the company have received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of these products. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact a healthcare provider.
FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and to ensure that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration, and in the most severe cases, kidney failure. The very young, seniors and persons with weak immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness.
FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature.
Consumers and media with questions regarding the recall should contact the company's Plant Manager, Mike Smith, at (801) 571-3611.",biological,"meat, egg and dairy products",escherichia coli,beef products

1528,2014,2,11,us,Utah Firm Recalls Various Beef Jerky Products Due to Misbranding and Undeclared Allergen,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 11, 2014 – Prime Snax Incorporated, a Salt Lake City, Utah establishment, is recalling approximately 90,000 pounds of beef jerky products because of misbranding and an undeclared allergen, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. The products were processed with a releasing agent containing soy lecithin, a known allergen that is not declared on the label.

The products subject to recall were produced prior to Feb. 2, 2014, and were shipped to retail locations nationwide. The Beef Jerky products include:

Arizona Jacks Brand:

8 oz./24 count packages of “Original”

3.5 oz./24 count packages of “Peppered Rippled Cut” and “Original Rippled Cut”

6 oz./80 count packages of “Frontier Cuts – Hot,” “Frontier Cuts – Pepper,” and “Frontier Cuts– Original”

The products subject to recall bear the establishment number “EST. 18951” inside the USDA Mark of Inspection and a date on the packages prior to August 11, 2015, in the format of “mm dd yy.”

The problem was discovered by an FSIS in-plant inspector during a label review. The firm believed the releasing agent was a processing aid that did not need to be declared on the label.

FSIS and the company have received no reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about a reaction should contact a healthcare provider.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

Consumers with questions about the recall should contact Jackie Pappas at (801) 977-0742. Media with questions about the recall should contact Zaira Pesantes at (801) 977-0742, ext. 142.

This E.coli strain found in the bag has been linked to 17 illness in eight states. The food source of the E.coli strain for all cases remains under investigation, but out of an abundance of caution, ADM is expanding its previous recall notice of only two specific lots to include all Baker’s Corner All Purpose Flour five-pound bags currently in distribution that were manufactured for ALDI at ADM’s flour mill in Buffalo, New York. The recall includes products distributed in select stores in 11 states: Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia. ADM Milling is working directly with ALDI, which has already recalled all potentially impacted products from store shelves in the region. ADM Milling is conducting an in-depth investigation to determine the cause of the contamination and is working closely with regulators throughout this process. ADM reminds customers and consumers that flour is not ready-to-eat and must be thoroughly cooked before eating to prevent illness from possible bacteria in the flour. Do not eat or play with raw dough, and wash hands, utensils and surfaces after handling. Any consumers concerned about an illness should contact a physician. If customers have product affected by this voluntary recall, they should discard it immediately or return it to their local ALDI store for a full refund. Please direct any customer inquiries for ADM Milling to 800-422-1688 between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Central Time Monday through Friday.

2962,2017,10,18,us,Stonyfield Announces Nationwide Voluntary Recall of Specific Code Date of Strawberry O'Soy Soy Yogurt,"Organic yogurt maker, Stonyfield, is voluntarily recalling a specific code date of its O’Soy Strawberry soy yogurt because it may contain an undeclared milk allergen. People who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to milk run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume this product.
Product was initially distributed to the following states and the list will be updated as information becomes available: CA, CT, FL, IA, IL, MA, MD, ME, MI, NC, NH, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, VA, WI. The yogurts are sold at natural food stores and grocery retailers nationwide. 
The specific product being recalled comes in 5.3 ounce cups and has the code date of November 4, 2017 on the lid and carrying the following product code printed along the side of the cup: O’Soy Strawberry UPC Code:0-52159 00603-7.
Consumers who may have purchased the potentially affected O’Soy Strawberry soy yogurts with this code date are asked to immediately dispose of them. Stonyfield is advising their distribution network to immediately remove these specific code-dated yogurts from retail shelves.
The recall is due to the possibility that some product shipped from its Londonderry plant may contain dairy yogurt instead of soy yogurt as labeled. The issue was identified after receiving two consumer complaints. No injuries or illnesses have been reported to date. Although the company believes the problem is not widespread, it is taking this measure to ensure the safety of its consumers.
“Our first priority has always been and will always be the health and well-being of our consumers,” says Esteve Torrens, Stonyfield CE-Yo. “While we continue to investigate this issue we believe recalling all potentially affected cups is the most responsible and transparent choice at this time.”
Consumers with questions should contact Stonyfield Consumer Relations at 1-800-PRO-COWS, Monday- Friday 9-12pm, 1:30-5pm, or email us at crelations@Stonyfield.com.

Due to the popularity of the product and proactive measures that have been taken, it is believed that no product remains in retail distribution.

To locate the production code, consumers should look on the glass jar itself below the cap and above the label. Pictures of product bearing the affected lot codes appear at the end of this press release.
Consumers who may have purchased the recalled Chunky Salsa should not consume the product, but instead should return it to the store for a full refund.
Olam Tomato Processors is dedicated to product quality, and the health and safety of its consumers. For these reasons, Olam Tomato Processors has voluntarily initiated this recall. We apologize to consumers and sincerely regret any inconvenience created by this voluntary product recall.

3109,2018,1,22,us,Sun Noodle - New Jersey - Issues Allergy Alert on Undeclared Fish in Tonkotsu Ramen,"Sun Noodle of Carlstadt, NJ is voluntarily recalling one lot of their retail Tonkotsu Ramen because it is mis-labeled. While it is labeled Tonkotsu, the actual flavor packet inside is Assari Shoyu, which contains an additional undeclared allergen of fish (sardines). Our concern is for those individuals who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to fish (sardines). They run the risk of a serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume this product.
Only one lot of Tonkotsu Ramen was mislabeled, and was primarily sent to Asian food distributors in the New Jersey, Georgia, Illinois, Texas, and New York areas, and then on to retail stores. The product is packaged in a clear plastic clamshell, banded with a Sun Noodle label that reads ""Tonkotsu Ramen."" The affected product contains 2 purple and white soup base packets, which correctly show the name ""Assari Shoyu"" flavor. The products affected by the recall are labeled with lot code 3117332.
No illnesses have been reported to date, and all affected product has already been removed from store shelves. We are sending out this release to alert any retail customers who may not have heard about it.
The decision to recall this product was initiated after it was discovered that the product had the wrong label applied to the product, and did not accurately represent what was packaged. Subsequent investigation indicated that the problem was caused by mis-labeling of the product at the New Jersey facility.
Note that only one particular lot of Tonkotsu Ramen was mislabeled. All other lots of Tonkotsu Ramen and all other products manufactured at other Sun Noodle locations are properly packed and labeled.
Consumers who have purchased any of the affected lot of Tonkotsu Ramen are urged to return the product to the original location of the purchase for a full refund.

3724,2018,11,16,us,The Quaker Oats Company Issues Voluntary Recall of a Small Quantity of Cap’n Crunch’s Peanut Butter Crunch Cereal Distributed to Five Target Stores Due to Possible Health Risk,"The Quaker Oats Company, a subsidiary of PepsiCo, Inc., today announced a voluntary recall of a small quantity of Cap’n Crunch’s Peanut Butter Crunch cereal due to the potential presence of Salmonella. While the potentially affected product only reached five specific Target stores and is limited to 21 boxes of one variety with two Best Before Dates, Quaker is initiating the voluntary recall to protect public health.
The recall was initiated as the result of a routine sampling program by the company, which revealed the finished product may contain bacteria. Salmonella is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
The product being recalled was distributed in limited quantities only to the five Target stores listed below. This recall only includes 21 outstanding boxes purchased after Nov 5:
17.1 ounce boxes of Cap’n Crunch’s Peanut Butter Crunch cereal with UPC code 0 30000 6211 1 and Best Before Dates of JUL 30 19 or JUL 31 19 purchased at the following Target stores:
A picture of the product listed above and information about how to identify the recalled products can be found on www.capncrunch.com and is provided below.
There are no other Quaker products being recalled. The company is working closely with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to further investigate this issue and ensure the recalled products are removed from store shelves and are no longer distributed. In the meantime, the company is taking these actions out of commitment to and concern for consumers. No illnesses related to Salmonella have been confirmed to date.
Consumers who have purchased the above products are advised not to consume them, and urged to dispose of or return them to the place of purchase for a full refund. They can direct any questions to 800-234-6281, Monday – Friday, 8:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. (EST), or find more information at cu.pepsico.com/capncrunch.

Approximately 2.25-2.3 lb. vacuum-packed sticks of “SMOKEHOUSE DELI KARPATSKAYA SMOKED COOKED SALAMI”
The product subject to recall bears the establishment number “1029 SEOH” inside the Cooperative Interstate Shipment mark of inspection. This establishment is an Ohio state-inspected plant which participates in USDA’s Cooperative Interstate Shipment (CIS) program. Under CIS, state-inspected plants can operate as federally-inspected facilities, under specific conditions, and ship their product in interstate commerce and internationally. “Sell By” dates for the recalled product range from Mar. 16, 2015, to Mar. 19, 2015.

3458,2018,7,5,hk,Consumers urged not to consume prepackaged ginger powder contaminated with aflatoxins,"Consumers urged not to consume prepackaged ginger powder contaminated with aflatoxins The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (July 5) urged the public not to consume a batch of prepackaged ginger powder manufactured in India as it was found contaminated with aflatoxins. The trade should also stop using or selling the affected product immediately if they possess it. Product details are as follows: Product name: Organic Ginger Powder Brand: SpiceBox Place of origin: India Distributor: SpiceBox Organics Limited Net weight: 50 grams per pack Best-before date: March 30, 2019 A spokesman for the CFS said, ""The CFS collected the above-mentioned sample from a shop in the Mid-levels for testing under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The results showed that it contained aflatoxins at a level of 20 micrograms (µg) per kilogram."" Under the Harmful Substances in Food Regulation (Cap 132 AF), the maximum permitted concentration for aflatoxins in food (except for peanuts or peanut products) is 15µg/kg. The spokesman said, ""The CFS has informed the vendor concerned of the irregularity and the vendor has removed from shelves and stopped sale of the affected product according to the CFS' instructions. Should there be sufficient evidence, prosecution will be instituted. The Centre is also tracing the source and distribution of the affected product."" The World Health Organization (WHO)'s International Agency for Research on Cancer classified naturally occurring aflatoxins as carcinogenic to humans, and the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives advised that intake of aflatoxins should be reduced to levels as low as reasonably possible although no health-based guidance value has been set. Aflatoxins can lead to liver cancer after long-term ingestion, and the risk for hepatitis B carriers is relatively high. The spokesman urged members of the public who had bought the affected batch of the product to stop consuming it. To avoid excessive intake of mycotoxins, people should maintain a balanced and varied diet to minimise the risk from a small range of food items, and to avoid consuming food that looks mouldy or damaged. The CFS will alert the trade, continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action. Investigation is ongoing.     Ends/Thursday, July 5, 2018",chemical,herbs and spices,Aflatoxin,ginger powder

2791,2017,5,31,na,"Smucker Foods of Canada Corp. Announces a Voluntary Recall on Select Golden Temple®, Swad®, and Maya® Flour Products in the U.S. Due to Possible E. Coli 0121 Contamination","Markham, ON Canada – In collaboration with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Smucker Foods of Canada Corp. today announced a voluntary recall on specific production codes of Golden Temple®, Swad®, and Maya® flour products in the U.S. due to possible E. coli 0121 contamination.
The impacted product was produced by Ardent Mills located in Saskatoon, SK Canada. Additional flour and flour products have been voluntarily recalled in Canada in cooperation with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency as part of their ongoing E. Coli investigation.
No other Smucker Foods of Canada Corp. products distributed in the U.S. are affected by this recall.
Impacted product is packaged in 20 lb. paper bags and was distributed nationwide to 19 distributors and two small retailers.
Some strains of E. coli create potentially deadly bacterium that can cause bloody diarrhea and dehydration. Although most healthy adults can recover completely within a week, some people can develop a form of kidney failure called Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS). HUS is most likely to occur in young children and the elderly and those with compromised immune systems. The condition can lead to serious kidney failure and even death. Any consumers concerned about an illness should contact a physician.
There are no reported illnesses to date associated with the U.S. product recall.
If you have any of the products listed below, please dispose of them immediately. Consumers with impacted product are urged to contact the company at 1-888-569-6728 Monday through Friday 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM ET for a product replacement coupon.   
The FDA offers these tips for safe flour handling and usage:
The recall is being conducted in cooperation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

  FSIS Announcement
  
  
  
            Editor’s note: Details of this public health alert were updated on May 25, 2021 to reflect a change on product distribution dates and to include a list of distribution locations.

WASHINGTON, May 24, 2021 - The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is issuing a public health alert for approximately 130,860 pounds of frozen fully cooked, diced chicken products because they may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes.

The frozen, fully cooked, diced chicken items were packed on Jan. 25, 2021, Jan. 26, 2021, March 23, 2021, and March 24, 2021. The following products are subject to the public health alert:

4-lb. plastic bags containing ""FULLY COOKED CHICKEN MEAT ¾ DICED WHITE"" with code 13530, Est. number P-18237, and pack dates of ""01/25/2021"" and ""01/26/2021.""
	4-lb. plastic bags containing ""FULLY COOKED CHICKEN MEAT DARK/WHITE ¾ DICED"" with code 16598, Est. number P-45638, and pack dates ""24/MAR/2021"" and ""23/MAR/2021.""
The products bear establishment numbers “P-18237” or “P-45638” inside the USDA mark of inspection and were distributed by Big Daddy Foods, Inc., a Houston, Texas firm. These items were further distributed to consumers at local food banks in Florida through the USDA Farmers to Families Food Box program in individual food boxes. The products were distributed between Feb. 24, 2021 through March 1, 2021, and March 29, 2021 through April 8, 2021, at temporary locations. More distribution details can be found here: Distribution List 1 and Distribution List 2.

The problem was discovered during routine FSIS inspection activities when inspection personnel observed products requiring recooking due to possible Lm contamination had been repackaged without being recooked. A subsequent FSIS investigation determined other affected product had been further distributed in commerce. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an illness should contact a health care provider.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections can occur in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

Consumers who have received these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away.

FSIS advises all consumers to reheat ready-to-eat product until steaming hot.

Consumers with food safety questions can call the toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854) or live chat via Ask USDA from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday. Consumers can also browse food safety messages at Ask USDA or send a question via email to  MPHotline@usda.gov . For consumers that need to report a problem with a meat, poultry, or egg product, the online Electronic Consumer Complaint Monitoring System can be accessed 24 hours a day at https://foodcomplaint.fsis.usda.gov/eCCF/.

2455,2016,10,1,us,"Silver Springs Farms, Inc. Recalls Beef Products Due to Possible E. Coli O157:H7 Contamination","WASHINGTON, Sept. 30, 2016 – Silver Springs Farms, Inc., a Harleysville, Pa. establishment is recalling approximately 740 pounds of ground beef products that may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The ground beef items were produced on August 19, 2016. The following products are subject to recall: [Label]

20-lb cases containing 4 packages of 5-lb ground beef 80/20.
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 4771” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to a distributor in Virginia.

The problem was discovered during a routine verification sampling performed by Silver Springs Farms, Inc. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.

E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2–8 days (3–4 days, on average) after exposure the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of160° F.

Issues Allergy Alert on Undeclared Milk in Rice Cake Soup","Ottogi America, Inc. of Gardena, CA is recalling 6.40 ounce “Rice cake soup” food, because it may contain undeclared milk. People who have allergies to milk run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume these products.
The recalled “Rice Cake Soup” was distributed nationwide in retail stores. The product comes in a 6.40 ounce, yellow paper bowl package marked with Item No: 29409101 on the back with an expiration date of June 20th 2018 stamped under the case.
No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem.
The recall was initiated after it was discovered that the milk-containing product was distributed in packaging that did not reveal the presence of milk. Subsequent investigation indicates the problem was caused by a misprinting in the company's packaging processes.
Production of the product has been suspended until FDA and the company are certain that the problem has been corrected.
Consumers who have purchased 6.40 ounce packages of ""Rice cake soup"" are urged to return them to the place of purchase for a full refund.

The recalled products have been sold nationally. What you should do If you think you became sick from consuming a recalled product, call your doctor Check to see if you have the recalled products in your home or establishment Do not consume the recalled products Do not serve, use, sell, or distribute the recalled products Recalled products should be thrown out or returned to the location where they were purchased Food contaminated with Cronobacter sakazakii may not look or smell spoiled but can still make you sick. Although Cronobacter sakazakii is not commonly linked to human illness, in rare cases it can cause serious or fatal infections. Cronobacter sakazakii can cause rare bloodstream and central nervous system infections and has been associated with severe intestinal infection (necrotizing enterocolitis) and blood poisoning (sepsis), especially in newborns. Food contaminated with Salmonella may not look or smell spoiled but can still make you sick. Young children, pregnant women, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems may contract serious and sometimes deadly infections. Healthy people may experience short-term symptoms such as fever, headache, vomiting, nausea, abdominal cramps and diarrhea. Long-term complications may include severe arthritis.

The products include Hy-Vee Garden Style Salad Topping, Hy-Vee Trail Mix Bars, Hy-Vee Peanut Almond Dark Chocolate Protein Bars, Hy-Vee Caramel Cashew Honey Crunch Trail Mix, Hy-Vee Dark Chocolate Cranberry Trail Mix, Hy-Vee Raisin and Nut Trail Mix, and Hy-Vee Santa Fe Trail Mix.
The potential for contamination was discovered after Hy-Vee’s sunflower kernel supplier, SunOpta, announced they were recalling specific lots of sunflower kernels due to the potential for Listeria monocytogenes. The initial recall was limited to sunflower kernel products produced at SunOpta’s Crookston, Minnesota, facility; however, this week, the recall was expanded even further to include additional products supplied to Hy-Vee and other retailers across the U.S.
Listeria monocytogenes is an organism, which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria monocytogenes infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.
To date, no illnesses have been reported in connection with these products.
Out of an abundance of caution, Hy-Vee is recalling the following salad topping from all of its stores:

About allergy alerts
Sometimes there will be a problem with a food product that means it should not be sold. Then it might be 'withdrawn' (taken off the shelves) or 'recalled' (when customers are asked to return the product). Sometimes foods have to be withdrawn or recalled if there is a risk to consumers because the allergy labelling is missing or incorrect or if there is any other food allergy risk.

2569,2016,12,19,us,H-E-B Issues Voluntary Recall On Bakery Products,"San Antonio, TX - In cooperation with Dawn Food Products, Inc., H-E-B announced today that it has issued a voluntary recall for certain bakery products made with Valley Milk Products LLC’s High Heat Nonfat Dry Milk Powder. As part of a larger recall affecting several retailers, Valley Milk Products has recalled the affected product, which was supplied to H-E-B for use in bakery products.
The product is being removed because there is potential it could be contaminated with Salmonella, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (e.g., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. The issue was discovered through FDA routine sampling.
There have been no reports of illness to date in connection with bakery items purchased from H-E-B stores or items made with product supplied by Dawn Foods. All product has been removed from stores.
The recall affects product sold in H-E-B and Mi Tienda in-store bakeries in Texas and Mexico, including the following:
Customers who purchased the affected product can return the product to the store for a full refund. Customers with any questions or concerns may contact H-E-B Customer Service at 1-855-432-4438, Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Central Standard Time.

5277,2021,1,5,hk,Undeclared allergen (sulphur dioxide and sorbic acid) found in prepackaged date sample,"Undeclared allergen (sulphur dioxide and sorbic acid) found in prepackaged date sample Issue Date 5.1.2021 Source of Information Centre for Food Safety (CFS) Food Product Prepackaged date Product Name and Description Product name: (Not available in English) Place of origin: China Distributor: Premier Food Ltd Net weight: 450 grams per pack Best-before date: December 31, 2021 Reason For Issuing Alert Subsequent to announcing earlier that a prepackaged date sample taken from an online shop was detected with excessive preservative and in breach of the food labelling regulation, the CFS took another date sample from the same distributor from a shop in a shopping centre in West Kowloon for testing during follow-up investigations. The test result showed that the sample contained sorbic acid at a level of 69 parts per million (ppm) and sulphur dioxide at a level of 41 ppm. Although the levels are within the legal limits, the functional class and names of the two additives were not declared on the food label of the sample. Sulphur dioxide is a commonly used preservative in a variety of foods including dried vegetables, dried fruits, pickled vegetables and salted fish products. Sulphur dioxide is water soluble, and most of it can be removed through washing and cooking. However, susceptible individuals who are allergic to this preservative may experience breathing difficulties, headaches and nausea after consumption. Action Taken by the Centre for Food Safety The CFS has informed the vendor concerned of the irregularity. The distributor concerned has initiated a recall on the affected batch of the product according to the CFS's instructions. The CFS will alert the trade, continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action. Investigation is ongoing. Advice to the Trade Stop using or selling the affected batch of the product immediately if they possess it. Advice to Consumers Should not consume the affected batch of the product.

What you should do If you think you became sick from consuming a recalled product, call your doctor Check to see if you have recalled products Do not consume recalled products Recalled products should be thrown out or returned to the location where they were purchased People with norovirus illness usually develop symptoms of gastroenteritis within 24 to 48 hours, but symptoms can start as early as 12 hours after exposure. The illness often begins suddenly. Even after having the illness, you can still become re-infected by norovirus. The main symptoms of norovirus illness are diarrhea, vomiting (children usually experience more vomiting than adults), nausea and stomach cramps. Other symptoms may include low-grade fever, headache, chills, muscle aches and fatigue (a general sense of tiredness).  Most people feel better within one or two days, with symptoms resolving on their own, and experience no long-term health effects. As with any illness causing diarrhea or vomiting, people who are ill should drink plenty of liquids to replace lost body fluids and prevent dehydration. In severe cases, patients may need to be hospitalized and given fluids intravenously.

The products subject to recall include:

10-lb. cardboard boxes, containing 4 individual cryovac sealed packages of May’s Hawaii “Hawaiian Style, Boneless and Skinless Teriyaki Chicken Thighs.”

The problem was discovered during shipment when the company’s distributor observed boxes of product swollen with gases from the bagged chicken, an indication that there may have been temperature abuse during storage prior to product distribution.

FSIS and the company have received no reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about a reaction should contact a healthcare provider.

1022,2010,4,5,us,North Dakota Firm Recalls Whole Beef Head Products That Contain Prohibited Materials,"WASHINGTON, April 5, 2010 - North American Bison Co-Op, a New Rockford, N.D., establishment is recalling approximately 25,000 pounds of whole beef heads containing tongues that may not have had the tonsils completely removed, which is not compliant with regulations that require the removal of tonsils from cattle of all ages, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.
                                  
 Tonsils are considered a specified risk material (SRM) and must be removed from cattle of all ages in accordance with FSIS regulations. SRMs are tissues that are known to contain the infective agent in cattle infected with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), as well as materials that are closely associated with these potentially infective tissues. Therefore, FSIS prohibits SRMs from use as human food to minimize potential human exposure to the BSE agent.
                                  
 The product subject to recall includes: 
                                   Various weight cases of ""Beef Heads KEEP FROZEN."" Each case bears the establishment number ""EST. 18859"" inside the USDA mark of inspection and a case code number ""16999."" ""North Dakota Natural Beef"" is printed in the bottom left-hand corner of each label.
                                  
 The recalled products were produced between June 25, 2009, and February 19, 2010. These products were shipped to distribution centers in Md., CO, and Minn. for further sale.
                                  
 The problem was discovered during FSIS inspection activities at the establishment. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.
                                  
 Media with questions about the recall should contact Philip Wicke, Vice President of Operations, at (701) 356-7723.

The raw ground beef and pork items were produced and packaged on February 10, 2018 and February 12, 2018. The following products are subject to recall: [View Label (PDF only)]

2.25-lb. wrapped packages of fresh “ALL NATURAL EXTRA LEAN GROUND BEEF” containing package code 04118 and with 96% lean and 4% fat on the label.

2.25-lb. wrapped packages of fresh “ALL NATURAL GROUND BEEF CHUCK” containing package code 04118 and with 80% lean and 20% fat on the label.

2.50-lb. bag containing 10 quarter pound frozen “BROTHERS CHOICE 85% LEAN ANGUS GROUND BEEF PATTIES” containing package code 04318.
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “965” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations in Oregon, Utah, and Washington state.

The problem was discovered when the firm notified FSIS Inspection Program Personnel (IPP) that the firm’s sample of beef trim was positive for E. coli O157:H7 based on results by their third party lab. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.

E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2–8 days (3–4 days, on average) after exposure to the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground meat that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground meat is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

2048,2016,1,27,us,Figi's Issues Recall Alert on Mislabeled Marzipan,"Figi's Companies, Inc. of Marshfield, WI is recalling 8 ounce packages of ""Classic Marzipan"" because the ingredients are not properly labeled and the product contains undeclared almonds. People who have allergies to almonds run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume these products.
The recalled ""Classic Marzipan"" was distributed nationwide through mail orders and at one retail outlet.
The product comes in a kraft colored corrugated container with red printed decorations including the Figi's Logo. It is labeled with a white and red product label in the upper right hand corner that identifies the item as 100-0034-200 ""Classic Marzipan"" and has a code date in a smaller yellow box in the lower left hand corner of that label. The code date will read either ""5 190"", ""5 194"", ""5 253"" or ""5 328."" The product itself is contained within a gold foil covered paperboard tray with a clear acetate cover. The package includes Figi's Special Gift Notice/Product Guarantee that is preprinted on the reverse side with the Nutritional Facts Panel for ""Assorted Fruit Shaped Marzipan"" and identified with the part number 380-0034-515.

No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem.
The recall was initiated after it was discovered that the almond containing product was not labeled with ingredients nor were the presence of almonds highlighted.

Production of the product has been suspended until the company is certain that the problem has been corrected.
Consumers who have purchased or received as gifts, 8 oz. packages of Classic Marzipan are urged to return them to Figi's for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact the company Monday - Saturday, 7AM - 5:30PM CST at 1-800-437-3817.",allergens,confectionery,almond,marzipan
