1009,2010,2,5,us,2010 - turkey hill dairy issues recall on chocolate marshmallow ice cream that may contain undeclared treenuts (almonds),"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE – LANCASTER COUNTY, Pa., February 05, 2010 – Turkey Hill Dairy of Conestoga, Pa., is recalling its 1.5 qt. (48 oz./1.42L) packages of Chocolate Marshmallow Premium Ice Cream because the product may contain almonds that were inadvertently added during production.
No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this issue, although people who have allergies to almonds run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reactions if they consume these products. The product is safe for consumption by consumers without nut allergies.
The recalled Chocolate Marshmallow Premium Ice Cream is limited only to select stores in central Pennsylvania. All affected stores are directly delivered to and serviced by Turkey Hill Dairy and have been instructed to remove the product from their shelves.  
The recall was initiated after it was discovered that the recalled product was distributed in packaging that did not identify almonds as an ingredient. It is believed that less than 150 containers of ice cream were potentially exposed to almonds. All affected containers would have been purchased by consumers after January 28, 2010
The product comes in a rounded, rectangular, cream-colored, paperboard, 48 oz. packages with farm scene and ice cream scoop graphics. The affected product is marked on the bottom of the package with the code “01/18/2011 56/L1”. Preceding the code is a four-digit number indicating the production time. The recalled product includes a time between 02:25 and 02:35.  
Consumers who have purchased affected 48 oz. packages of Chocolate Marshmallow Premium Ice Cream with the previously mentioned code can return them to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact Turkey Hill Dairy at 1-800-MY-DAIRY (1-800-693-2479).",allergens,ices and desserts,almond,ice cream

In some cases, a 'Food Alert for Action' is issued. This provides local authorities with details of specific action to be taken on behalf of consumers.

After further analysis, Aspen Foods chose to recall products in an effort to prevent additional illness. Details of this release were also updated to reflect a change in poundage and distribution area.


WASHINGTON, October 2, 2015 – Aspen Foods, a Chicago, Ill. establishment, is recalling approximately 561,000 pounds of frozen, raw, stuffed and breaded chicken products that appear to be ready-to-eat (RTE) and may be contaminated withSalmonella Enteritidis, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

Following the original recall on July 15, 2015, FSIS conducted intensified sampling at this establishment to ensure that the hazard responsible for the initial contamination had been controlled by Aspen Foods. Results from FSIS sampling revealed positive results that matched the outbreak strain of Salmonella Enteritidis to Aspen Foods products. With this and additional information, Aspen Foods chose to recall additional products in an effort to prevent additional illness. The scope of this recall expansion now includes all products associated with contaminated source material.

On July 15, 2015, Aspen Foods recalled approximately 1,978,680 pounds of frozen, raw, stuffed, and breaded chicken items that appear to be ready-to-eat (RTE) were produced between April 15, 2015 and July 10, 2015 with “best if used by” dates between July 14, 2016 and October 10, 2016. To view a full list of recalled products, please click here | Download XLS. The brands associated with this recall are the same as those listed above, excluding “Home Dining Selections"".

The product subject to recall bears the establishment number “P-1358” inside the USDA mark of inspection. This product was shipped to retail stores and food service locations nationwide.

FSIS was notified of a cluster of Salmonella Enteritidis illnesses on June 23, 2015. Working in conjunction with Minnesota State Departments of Health and Agriculture, FSIS determined that there is a link between the frozen, raw, stuffed and breaded chicken products that appear to be ready-to-eat (RTE) from Aspen Foods and this illness cluster. Based on epidemiological evidence and traceback investigations, five case-patients have been identified in Minnesota with illness onset dates ranging from May 9, 2015 to July 22, 2015. FSIS continues to work with the Minnesota Departments of Health and Agriculture as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on this investigation.

Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after exposure to the organism. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be in consumers' freezers. Although the product subject to recall may appear to be cooked, this product is in fact uncooked (raw) and should be handled carefully to avoid cross-contamination in the kitchen. Particular attention needs to be paid to safely prepare and cook these raw poultry products to a temperature of 165° F checking at the center, the thickest part and the surface of the product.

This frozen, raw, stuffed and breaded chicken product was labeled with instructions identifying that the product was raw and included cooking instructions for preparation. Some case-patients reported following the cooking instructions on the label and using a food thermometer to confirm that the recommended temperature was achieved. Therefore, FSIS advises all consumers to treat this product like a raw chicken product. Hands and any surfaces, including surfaces that may have breading dislodged from the product, should be cleaned after contact with this raw product. Also, keep raw poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use one cutting board for raw poultry and a separate one for fresh produce and cooked foods.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

Consumers with questions can contact the company directly at (844) 277-6802. Media with questions can contact Gene Grabowski, Media Representative, at (202) 270-6560.

Consumers with food safety questions can ""Ask Karen,"" the FSIS virtual representative available 24 hours a day at AskKaren.gov or via smartphone at m.askkaren.gov.The toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline 1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854) is available in English and Spanish and can be reached from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday.

WASHINGTON, July 15, 2016 – ConAgra Foods, a Russellville, Ark. establishment, is recalling approximately 195,597 pounds of frozen chicken and beef entrée products that may be contaminated with extraneous materials, specifically metal, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. The metal fragments range in size between 2 and 9 millimeters (mm) in diameter, and are curled, malleable and shiny. The metal fragments may be embedded in the sauce contained within the frozen entrée products.

The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 233” or “EST. P-115” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to distributors and retail locations nationwide.

The problem was initially discovered on July 1, 2016, when an establishment employee observed metal fragments while dispensing sugar from a supplier for sauce formulation during processing. The resulting sauce is a component in the frozen entrée products. On July 14, 2016, ConAgra Foods was notified by the supplier of an FDA recall involving multiple production lots of sugar due to potential metal contamination. The recall action involved additional lots of sugar potentially used in FSIS regulated products at ConAgra Foods, and resulted in this expansion of the initial recall action.

There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions or injuries due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

2361,2016,7,21,us,Kapowsin Meats Inc. Recalls Pork Products Due To Possible Salmonella Contamination,"WASHINGTON, July 21, 2016 – Kapowsin Meats Inc., a Graham, Wash. establishment, is recalling approximately 11,658 pounds of pork products that may be contaminated with Salmonella I 4,[5],12:i:-, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The whole roaster hogs were produced between June 13, 2016 and July 15, 2016. The following products are subject to recall: [View Label]

Varying weights of boxed/bagged Whole Hogs for Barbeque
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 1628M” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to various individuals, retail locations, institutions, and distributors in Washington.

FSIS was notified of an illness investigation in Washington on July 13, 2016. The Washington State Department of Health updated FSIS on July 19, 2016 of confirmed case-patients involved in an illness outbreak of Salmonella I 4,[5],12:i:-. Working in conjunction with the Washington State Department of Health, local health departments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), FSIS determined that there is a highly probable link between whole hogs for barbeque from Kapowsin Meats and this illness cluster. Based on epidemiological investigation, three Salmonella I 4,[5],12:i:- case-patients have been identified with illness onset dates ranging from July 5, 2016, to July 7, 2016. Traceback investigation indicated that three case-patients consumed whole hog roasters for barbeque from Kapowsin Meats. At this time, it is not known if this outbreak strain has any drug resistance; results are pending.

This investigation is ongoing. FSIS continues to work with public health partners at the Washington State Department of Health, local health and the CDC on this investigation.

Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after exposure to the organism. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume pork and whole hogs for barbeque that have been cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 145° F with a three minute rest time. The only way to confirm that whole hogs for barbeque are cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ. For whole hogs for barbeque make sure to check the internal temperature with a food thermometer in numerous places, including near the bone. Check the temperature frequently and replenish wood or coals to make sure the fire stays hot. Remove only enough meat from the carcass as you can serve within 1-2 hours.

Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact John Anderson, Owner, at (253) 847-1777.

Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers’ refrigerators or freezers or both. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

Issues Alert on Sausage Egg Cheese Muffin Because of Possible Health Risk,"Progressive Gourmet Inc. of Wilmington, MA, is recalling its 6 ounce packages of Sausage, Egg, and Cheddar Cheese on English Muffin breakfast sandwiches manufactured for Starbucks Coffee Co. out of the abundance of caution because they have the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. Listeria monocytogenes, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems.

These potentially impacted sandwiches were possibly sold to consumers by select Starbucks stores in Arkansas, Texas and Oklahoma Starbucks Stores on 3/3/16 and 3/4/16. The sandwiches may be heated at the store level for immediate consumption.
This recall is limited to impacted 250 stores in Arkansas, Texas and Oklahoma only. (The recalled sandwiches were distributed to warehouses in Maryland, North Carolina, Texas and Louisiana).
As soon as Starbucks was informed of this potential issue, the impacted product was removed from the 250 stores that potentially received it. The scope of this issue is limited to these stores.
The potential for contamination was noted after routine testing by the company revealed the presence of Listeria monocytogenes on a contact surface within the production facility.
No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this product.
Progressive Gourmet is working closely with FDA and the Massachusetts Department of Health and continues to investigate the source of the problem.

2041,2016,1,21,us,Snapp's Ferry Packing Company Recalls Beef Product Due To Possible E. Coli O157:H7 Contamination,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 20, 2016 – Snapp’s Ferry Packing Company, an Afton, Tenn. establishment, is recalling approximately 410 pounds of beef product that may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The ground beef item was produced on Nov. 20, 2015. The following product is subject to recall: [View Label]

5-lb. packages of “Ground Beef,” with a packaging date of Nov. 20, 2015.
The product subject to recall bears establishment number “Est. 9085” inside the USDA mark of inspection. The item was distributed to restaurants in the Knoxville, Tenn. area. None of this product was sold at retail.

The problem was discovered on Jan. 19, 2016, when a positive result for E. coli O157:H7 from FSIS testing was traced back to the establishment as a result of an ongoing illness investigation in Tennessee. FSIS is continuing to work with our public health partners at the Tennessee Department of Health and Knox County Health Department on this investigation and will provide updated information as it becomes available.

E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2–8 days (3–4 days, on average) after exposure the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm ground and boneless beef products are cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Jeremy Southerland, Owner, at (423) 638-7001.

WASHINGTON, July 26, 2016 – PT Farm, LLC, a North Haverhill, N.H. establishment, is recalling approximately 8,800 pounds of raw beef products that may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The raw, intact and non-intact beef product items (ground beef, ground beef patties and other sub-primal cuts) were produced between June 6 and June 16, 2016. The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF Only)]

Various weights and various sizes of raw intact and raw non-intact “Chestnut Farms” beef products packed in cardboard boxes.

	Various weights and various sizes of raw intact and raw non-intact “Miles Smith Farm” beef products packed in cardboard boxes.

The products subject to recall bear establishment number “M8868” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations and for institutional use in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont.

FSIS was notified of an E. coli O157:H7 illness cluster on July 20, 2016. Working in conjunction with the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, FSIS determined that there is a link between the beef products from PT Farm and this illness cluster. Based on epidemiological investigation, 14 case-patients have been identified with illness onset dates ranging from June 15 to July 10, 2016. Most of the 14 illnesses have been reported from New Hampshire (10), with 2 reported from Massachusetts, 1 from Maine, and 1 from Vermont. Traceback for 11 case-patients for whom data was available led back to a single slaughter date at PT Farm. This investigation is ongoing. FSIS continues to work with the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services on this investigation and will provide updated information as it becomes available.

E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2–8 days (3–4 days, on average) after exposure the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls. 

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume beef products that have been cooked to a temperature of 145° F for roasts with a three minute rest time and 160° F for ground meat. The only way to confirm that beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

The product contains wheat, a known allergen, which is not declared on the product label.

The frozen ready-to-eat chicken products are labeled as gluten free chicken breast tenders but contain chicken nugget products. The items were produced on August 30, 2019. The following products are subject to recall: [View labels(PDF only)]

22-oz. resealable plastic bags containing “Simply Smart Organics CHICKEN BREAST TENDERS GLUTEN FREE” with “Best By: 08 29 20,” UPC Bar Code: 0-72745-80489-2, and time stamps of 00:30 to 01:00 (inclusive).
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “P-33944” on the package label. These items were shipped to distributors and retail locations in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.                

The problem was discovered when the company notified FSIS that they received two consumer complaints regarding the mislabeled product.

There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers’ freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify that recalling firms are notifying their customers of the recall and that actions are being taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

Iovate initiated a voluntary recall when it became aware that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s assessment of 23 reports about consumers having experienced liver-related problems, as well as a small number of published case reports, was different from Iovate’s analysis.  On May 1, 2009, the FDA issued an advisory which states that, “Although the liver damage appears to be relatively rare, FDA believes consumers should not be exposed to unnecessary risk.”  The number of adverse event reports described by the FDA is small relative to the many millions of people who have used Hydroxycut products over the 7 years referenced by the FDA.  Iovate’s own assessment of the potential risk associated with the use of these products differs from that expressed by the Agency.  Every product marketed by Iovate is evaluated during its development for the safety of its individual ingredients.  Additionally, independent third-party experts from the leading independent scientific firm specializing in ingredient assessment, toxicology and product safety for the nutritional and pharmaceutical industry review the safety of Iovate’s ingredients and formulas before products are introduced in the marketplace.  Only after this external review is completed does Iovate release a formula.
However, out of an abundance of caution and because consumer safety is Iovate’s top priority, Iovate is voluntarily recalling these Hydroxycut-branded products.

Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. For more information on Salmonella, please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Website at http://www.cdc.gov.
The FDA and other regulatory agencies have indicated that Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) is the focus of their investigation concerning a recent Salmonella outbreak thought to be caused by tainted peanut butter.  PCA supplied Ralcorp Frozen Bakery Products with the peanut butter it used in the recalled cookies, prompting the voluntary recall.

1274,2012,10,9,us,2012 - Rich Products Corporation Announces Nationwide Voluntary Recall of Jon Donaire Peanut Butter Cup Ice Cream Cake and TCBY Peanut Buttery Fudge Deep Dish Frozen Yogurt Pie,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - October 9, 2012 - In response to the expanded Sunland, Inc. recall of all of its peanut butter products manufactured at its plant since March 31, 2010, Rich Products Corporation (“Rich’s”) on October 9, 2012 recalled its Jon Donaire® Peanut Butter Cup Ice Cream Cake (Product Code: 62683) and TCBY® Peanut Buttery Fudge Deep Dish Frozen Yogurt Pie (Product Code: 02772). Rich’s Quality Assurance Team has determined that the two products contain ingredients sourced from a supplier using Sunland, Inc. peanuts in the production of certain lots of the products and have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella. Specifically, the peanut butter ribbon provided by our supplier contains peanuts sourced from Sunland, Inc.  The products are produced by Rich’s in its Santa Fe Springs, California plant. Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.  In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. For more information on Salmonella, please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Web site at http://www.cdc.gov/ or call 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636). Rich’s has not received any reports of illness connected with this product and has issued this voluntary recall as a precautionary measure. The UPC code for the Jon Donaire® Peanut Butter Cup Ice Cream Cake is: 049800626836. Product produced from March 31, 2010 through July 6, 2012 (Julian Dates: 14070008-14072115 ) is affected.  The Jon Donaire® Peanut Butter Cup Ice Cream Cake is sold by the case primarily to in-store bakeries nationwide; a small amount of product is sold to food service distributors nationwide. Each individual unit is boxed with a best by date of (October 5, 2010 – January 19, 2013). The TCBY® Peanut Buttery Fudge Deep Dish Frozen Yogurt Pie does not have a UPC code and is sold by the case exclusively to TCBY® stores.  Product produced from March 31, 2010 to July 31, 2012 (Julian Date: 14070048 - 14072156) is affected.  TCBY® Peanut Buttery Fudge Deep Dish Frozen Yogurt Pie is not packaged for retail distribution. Each individual unit is labeled with a best by date of (November 14, 2010 – March 1, 2013). Rich’s has already notified all of its distributors and customers who have received the product in question, and has directed them to remove and destroy the affected product. All other affected product under Rich’s control has been quarantined and will be destroyed.  Rich’s will file with the Reportable Food Registry within 24 hours. Consumers with questions may contact the Rich’s Product Helpline at 1-800-356-7094 (United States) between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. EST. Voice mail is available after hours.

Subsequently Jumbo UK Ltd Palm Oil has been found to have originated from the same contaminated batch of palm oil as those previously notified. The affected product was manufactured in Ghana by Kokwe Farms Ltd, PO Box 15849, Accra, North Ghana and was imported by Jumbo UK Ltd, Unit 4A, Golden House, Waterden Road, London E15 2EE. Most of the product has been sold directly to the public from Jumbo UK Ltd. through their retail outlets but they have also distributed it to cash and carry stores and retail outlets in England. The product has not been distributed to or within Scotland. Products affected Jumbo UK Ltd Palm Oil 1 litre best before Dec 2005 Jumbo UK Ltd Palm Oil 2 litre best before Dec 2005 Identification of the product 1. Jumbo UK Ltd Palm Oil is bottled in a 1 litre opaque plastic bottle with a blue screw cap. The words PALM OIL pure oil from Nigeria, bottled exclusively for Jumbo UK Ltd; Waterden Road E15 2EE and a telephone number are all in red lettering on a white background. The 'best before' date is December 2005. 2. Jumbo UK Ltd Palm Oil is also bottled in a 2 litre opaque plastic bottle with an integral handle and a blue screw cap. The label is the same as that on the 1 litre bottle. The 'best before' date is December 2005. To assist local authorities in correct identification of this product, pictures can be viewed from the links at the foot of this page. Actions to be taken by local authorities This product presents a health risk if consumed in sufficient quantity, and does not comply with the food safety requirements specified in the Food Safety Act 1990 due to contamination with Sudan IV. In addition Sudan IV is not a permitted colour. If this product is found within their area, enforcement officers should ensure that it is withdrawn and destroyed, if necessary using powers under The Food Safety Act. Jumbo UK Ltd has undertaken a trade withdrawal and displayed point-of-sale notices in their retail outlet in the London Borough of Hackney. However, the withdrawal has not been successful and there remains the possibility that unused affected product is in consumers' homes. Local authorities are therefore asked to consider providing local publicity on this issue at the next available opportunity. It is essential that all non-unitary authorities liaise at county level to ensure that they co-ordinate their actions. It is expected that action by local authorities will be initiated as soon as possible after receipt of this food hazard warning.

3666,2018,10,19,us,SK Food Group Recalls Chicken Products due to Possible Salmonella and Listeria Monocytogenes Contamination in Vegetables,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 19, 2018 – SK Food Group, a Groveport, Ohio and Reno, Nev. establishment, is recalling approximately 174,207 pounds of chicken wrap products that contain vegetables that may be contaminated with Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.
The frozen, fully cooked chicken wrap items were produced on various dates from Oct. 15, 2017 through Oct. 15, 2018. The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF only)]

• 4.5-oz. plastic packages containing “jenny CRAIG CHICKEN WRAP WITH BBQ SAUCE,” with lot codes WO0096753S10, WO0097880S10, WO0098216S10, WO0098565S10, WO0098923S10, WO0100691S10, WO0100692S10, WO0101746S10, WO0101861S10, WO0102176S10, WO0102469S10, WO0102758S10, WO0103920S10, WO0104247S10, WO0104353S10, WO0104615S10, WO0104995S10, WO0106312, WO0106312S10, WO0106945S10, WO0107556S10, WO0108694S10, WO0108695S10, WO0096753S02, WO0097880S02, WO0098216S02, WO00982416S02, WO0098565S02, WO0098923S02, WO0100691S02, WO0100692S02 and WO0101746S02.
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 45367” or “EST. 20552” stamped on the product centerfold. These items were shipped directly to consumers through catalog sales in California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Texas.

The problem was discovered on Oct. 14, 2018, when SK Food Group received notification that the vegetables used in the production of their chicken wrap products were being recalled by their vegetable supplier due to Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella concerns.

There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider. 

Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.
Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms.

  FSIS Announcement
  
  
  
            WASHINGTON, Jan. 28, 2022 – The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is issuing a public health alert due to concerns that ready-to-eat (RTE) chicken salad products produced by Simply Fresh Market, a Marietta, Ga. establishment, may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. A recall was not requested because the known affected product is no longer available in commerce for consumers to purchase.
The RTE chicken salad with apples and walnuts items were produced on Jan. 17, 2022. The following product is subject to the public health alert [view label]:
8-oz and 16-oz. deli hinged containers of “simply fresh MARKET CHICKEN SALAD Apples & Walnuts” with a sell by date of “1/25” printed on the label.
The products bear establishment number “EST. P47170” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to three local markets in Atlanta, Ga.
The problem was discovered when the company notified FSIS that product sampling reported positiveListeria monocytogenesresults.
There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an illness should contact a health care provider.
Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.
Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections can occur in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.
FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers’ refrigerators. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.
Consumers with food safety questions can call the toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 888-MPHotline (888-674-6854) or live chat via Ask USDA from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday. Consumers can also browse food safety messages at Ask USDA or send a question via email to MPHotline@usda.gov. For consumers that need to report a problem with a meat, poultry, or egg product, the online Electronic Consumer Complaint Monitoring System can be accessed 24 hours a day at https://foodcomplaint.fsis.usda.gov/eCCF/.

2170,2016,4,21,us,Meating Place Recalls Beef Product Due to Possible E. Coli O157:H7 Contamination,"WASHINGTON, April 21, 2016 – Meating Place, a Buffalo, N.Y., establishment, is recalling approximately 325 pounds of ground beef product that may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The ground beef patties were produced on April 15, 2016. The following product is subject to recall: [View Label (PDF Only)]

5-lb. boxes of “LORIGO BRAND BEEF PATTIES KEEP FROZEN THE MEATING PLACE INC.” with a package code of 120106.
The product subject to recall bears establishment number “Est. 8631” inside the USDA mark of inspection. The item was shipped to retail and institutional locations in the Buffalo, NY area.

The problem was discovered by FSIS during routine in-plant review of testing results. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of this product.

E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2–8 days (3–4 days, on average) after exposure to the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age, but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Vincent Lorigo, President, at (716) 885-3623.

Wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw meat and poultry. Wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot, soapy water. Immediately clean spills.

Keep raw meat, fish, and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry, and egg products and cooked foods.

936,2009,2,4,us,"2009 - Unilever United States, Inc. Conducts Nationwide Voluntary Recall Of Breyers Tin Roof Sundae Ice Cream Products with Peanuts Due to Possible Health Risk","FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- February 4, 2009, Englewood Cliffs, NJ – Unilever United States, Inc. is voluntarily recalling Breyers Tin Roof Sundae ice cream products because they may contain peanuts that have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella.
Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems.  Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare cases, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses, such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.  For more information on Salmonella, please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Website at http://www.cdc.gov.
This voluntary product recall includes:
Product Name and Description:  Breyers Tin Roof Sundae – “Vanilla Ice Cream with Fudge Swirl & Chocolate Covered Peanuts,” 1.75 QUARTS (1.66 L) UPC:  77567 26462 (located on the side of the package under the bar code)
Product Name and Description:  Breyers Tin Roof Sundae – “Vanilla Light Ice Cream with Fudge Swirl with Chocolatey Coated Peanuts,” 1.75 QUARTS (1.66 L) UPC:  77567 26462 (located on the side of the package under the bar code)
The Breyers Tin Roof Sundae products, which were discontinued in August 2008, were sold in 1.75 QUART (1.66 L) paper board containers with various expiration dates.
The products were sold to retail establishments nationwide.
This precautionary action was taken as a result of the recently expanded recall by Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) to include all peanut ingredients produced in its Blakely, Georgia facility.  These Breyers products contained peanuts sourced at the Georgia facility.  None of the recalled Breyers products have been directly linked to the Salmonella outbreak, and there have been no illnesses reported. 
Consumers who have the Breyers Tin Roof Sundae product are asked to discard it and call 1-877-270-7392, which is operational 24 hours a day, for information on the recall.  In addition, a consumer services representative is available between the hours of 8:30 AM and 6:00 PM EST.
No other retail ice cream packaged Unilever products, including Ben & Jerry’s, Klondike, Popsicle – and other varieties of Breyers – are affected by the PCA recall.

5200,2020,12,3,hk,Not to consume boletes suspected to contain mixture of species including inedible or poisonous mushrooms,"Not to consume boletes suspected to contain mixture of species including inedible or poisonous mushrooms Issue Date 3.12.2020 Source of Information Centre for Food Safety Food Product Boletes Product Name and Description Product name: Boletes Importer: Yiu Shing Trading Company Supplier: (English name not available) Reason For Issuing Alert Following up on a food poisoning case suspected to have been caused by consuming boletes, which was referred earlier by the Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health, the CFS collected samples from the retail outlet which sold the product concerned, Go Fresh D, in Hung Hom for testing during its investigation. According to the assessment by a mycologist on the samples, the boletes concerned contained inedible or poisonous species of mushrooms. Mushroom poisoning is generally acute and manifested by a variety of symptoms, depending on the species and amount consumed. The incubation period is usually short.Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain are the commonest symptoms. Sometimes distinguishing features such as extreme thirst, profuse sweating, hallucination, coma and other neurological symptoms may occur. Action Taken by the Centre for Food Safety The CFS has also followed up with the importer, Yiu Shing Trading Company, and the supplier (English name not available). Preliminary investigations found that the importer had imported the affected product and sold it to the supplier. The product was then packed by the supplier for sale by the aforementioned retailer. The CFS has requested the vendors concerned to initiate a recall of the affected product. The CFS will continue to follow up on the case and take necessary action to safeguard food safety and public health. Advice to the Trade The trade should stop using or selling the product concerned immediately if they possess it. Advice to Consumers Do not buy mushroom products which may contain a mix of unknown species; Do not buy mushrooms which appear unhygienic (i.e. with growing substrates left on the product) or show signs of spoilage (with coloured spots/abnormal smell/slime, etc); Wash and cook mushrooms thoroughly before consumption; and Seek medical treatment immediately if mushroom poisoning is suspected. Members of the public may call the hotlines of the importer (2805 2017), supplier (2546 2868) or retailer (6110 1207) during office hours for enquiries about the recall.

3789,2018,12,16,us,Spokane Produce Voluntarily Recalls Northwest Cuisine Creations and Fresh&Local Sandwiches and Green Leaf Lettuce Filets,"Spokane Produce Inc. of Spokane, WA initiates a voluntary recall of sandwiches containing green leaf lettuce and foodservice lettuce filets following notice of a produce industry ingredient recall by Adam Bros. Farming Inc. Sandwich products bearing the Northwest Cuisine Creations and Fresh&Local labels. These prod- ucts are recalled because they may be contaminated with Escherichia coli O157:H7 bacteria (E. Coli O157:H7). E. coli O157:H7 causes a diarrheal illness often with bloody stools. Although most healthy adults can recover completely within a week, some people can develop a form of kidney failure called Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS). HUS is most likely to occur in young children and the elderly. The condition can lead to serious kidney damage and even death.
All sandwiches bear the “best buy” dating 12/14/18-12/21/18. The product was distributed to grocery markets in Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and Oregon. In addition, Green Leaf Filets (no label) in five(5) and ten(10) pound containers are being recalled from foodservice accounts.
The affected products distributed by Spokane Produce include green leaf lettuce that was originated and recalled from Adam Bros. Farming Inc. of Santa Maria, CA. The recall was initiated after it was discovered that sediment from a reservoir near where the Adam Bros. Farm produce was grown tested positive for E.coli O157:H7. Filtered and treated water from the reservoir may have come in contact with the produce after it was harvested. None of the filtered, treated water has tested positive for E. coli, all E. coli tests returning negative.
“We are taking extreme precautionary measures,” notes Dan Petek, Spokane Produce spokesperson. “To date, there have been no cases of E coli or contamination from any Adam Bros. green leaf lettuce. In complete regard for the public at large and our customers, we believe it is prudent at this point to be proactive and call in all product.”
Out of an abundance of caution, as a service to the general consuming public at large, product is being recalled in consultation with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). No illnesses have been reported to date.
Consumers who purchased any of the sandwiches bearing the “best buy 12/14/18-12/21/18” are advised not to eat any product and should destroy or return the product to the place of purchase.

1608,2014,7,24,us,Texas Firm Recalls Ready-To-Eat Products for Possible Listeria Contamination,"EDITOR’S NOTE:This release was updated July 25 to correct the confirmation date for the Listeria monocytogenes positive test, as well as to provide an updated label sheet. The original release contained images of labels for products not included in the recall.


WASHINGTON, JULY 24, 2014– Great American Marketing, a Houston, Texas establishment, is recalling approximately 475 pounds of FSIS and FDA-regulated, ready-to-eat products due to possible contamination with Listeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The sandwich and wrap products were produced on July 15, 2014, and then shipped to retail locations in Texas. Case labels or packaging may bear the sell by date of 07/26/14.

Products regulated by FSIS bear the establishment number “EST 31680” or “P-31680” inside the USDA mark of inspection. The following FSIS-regulated products are subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF Only)]

7.4 ounce plastic-covered tray packages containing Chicken Caesar Wraps.

8.1 ounce plastic-covered tray packages containing Club Wraps.
FDA-regulated products being recalled (are listed at http://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls ) and include:

10.5 ounce plastic-covered tray packages containing Ham and Cheddar Premium sandwiches.

10.5 ounce plastic-covered tray packages containing Turkey & Swiss Premium sandwiches.
The problem was discovered when FSIS collected a sample of a separate product on July 15, 2014, that was confirmed positive for L. monocytogenes on July 21.The sampled product was held. However, the plant produced the additional FSIS and FDA regulated products listed in this recall without conducting a complete clean-up of the production equipment. Those products have entered commerce and are subject to recall. FSIS and the company have received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of these products.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website athttp://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

FSIS advises all consumers to reheat ready-to-eat product until steaming hot.

Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Bill Welch at (713) 682-6471.

Hiland Dairy Foods is notifying our direct customers by phone and/or in writing of the recalled products that contain PCA’s peanuts.  Consumers with recalled products may either discard them or return them to the store of purchase for a refund.  Consumers with questions may contact Hiland Dairy Foods at 1-800-492-4022 in Missouri or 1-800-641-4022 outside Missouri.  Consumers may also visit the FDA website at www.fda.gov for an updated list of products being recalled because of this problem.

4117,2019,6,14,us,"In Cooperation with ADM Milling Co., Hometown Food Company Issues Voluntary Recall of Specific Lot Codes Pillsbury® Best Bread Flour Due to Possible Health Risk","null Hometown Food Company, in cooperation with ADM Milling Co., today initiated a voluntary recall of two specific lot codes of its Pillsbury® Best 5 lb. Bread Flour due to a potential presence of pathogenic E. coli. The product was manufactured by ADM Milling Co., at the company’s mill in Buffalo, NY. The severity of E. coli infections vary among people and often include several symptoms, including severe stomach cramps, diarrhea (often bloody) and vomiting. People usually develop symptoms and get sick 3-4 days after ingesting the germ, and most recover within a week. In some cases, individuals may develop a serious illness called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS, which can result in kidney failure, stroke, and even death). Young children, elderly individuals, pregnant women and those who are immunocompromised are more susceptible to foodborne illness. If you feel ill or are at all concerned about an illness, please contact your physician. Approximately 4,620 cases of impacted Pillsbury® Best 5 lb. Bread Flour were distributed to a limited number of retailers and distributors across the following 10 states: Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. The affected product has the following UPC codes, lot codes and Best-If-Used-By dates: All products with other Best-If-Used-By Dates and Lot Codes are not affected by this recall. Best-If-Used By Dates can be found on the side of the package below the Nutrition Facts Panel. If you have the affected product in your home or business, do not consume it. Please discard it immediately or return it to the retail location it was purchased from for a refund. This voluntary recall is being made with the full knowledge of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. At Hometown Food Company, nothing is more important than the safety and integrity of our products. There have been no reports of any illnesses associated with this product and this recall has been issued out of an abundance of caution. Hometown Food Company has been informed by ADM Milling Co., that certain wheat used to make these two lots of Pillsbury® Best 5 lb. Bread Flour has been linked to E. coli illnesses associated with other flour products produced at the ADM mill in Buffalo. Please visit the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s website for more information on this illness outbreak. To date, no illnesses associated with Pillsbury® Best Bread Flour have been reported. Flour is made from wheat, which is a raw product that is minimally processed. Flour is not a ready-to-eat product. It is an ingredient for baked, fried and cooked recipes, and these heating processes, along with proper handling, ensure the safety of consuming flour. All surfaces and utensils should be properly cleaned after contact with flour or uncooked dough or batter. Consumers should wash their hands after handling flour or uncooked dough or batter. Consumers should not eat uncooked dough or batter made with raw flour. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this recall may cause, and are offering replacement coupons for your product. Please call our toll-free 800 number (1-866-219-9333), which will be staffed daily from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. CDT.

989,2009,10,15,us,Nebraska Firm Recalls Beef Tongues That Contain Prohibited Materials,"WASHINGTON, Oct 15, 2009 - J.F. O'Neill Packing Company, an Omaha, Neb., establishment is recalling approximately 33,000 pounds of beef tongues that may not have had the tonsils completely removed, which is not compliant with regulations that require the removal of tonsils from cattle of all ages, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.
                                  
 Tonsils are considered a specified risk material (SRM) and must be removed from cattle of all ages in accordance with FSIS regulations. SRMs are tissues that are known to contain the infective agent in cattle infected with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), as well as materials that are closely associated with these potentially infective tissues. Therefore, FSIS prohibits SRMs from use as human food to minimize potential human exposure to the BSE agent.

 The problem was discovered through a food safety assessment FSIS conducted at the establishment.
                                  
 FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers (including restaurants) of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

1454,2013,8,9,us,New York Firm Recalls Boneless Veal Products Due To Possible E. Coli Contamination,"WASHINGTON, August 9, 2013 – United Processing LLC, a New York Mills, NY firm, is recalling approximately 12,600 pounds of boneless veal products because they may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, E. coli O145 and E. coli O45 the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The following products are subject to FSIS recall:

60-lb. boxes of boneless veal
The products subject to recall bear the establishment number “M- 27450” inside the USDA mark of inspection on a generic box label. The products were produced on June 17, 18, 24, 28 and 29, 2013 then distributed to wholesalers in New York and California for further processing.

FSIS became aware of the problem during inspection program personnel review. The firm sampled the product per their food safety program, and inadvertently shipped the product into commerce.

FSIS and the company have received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of these products.

Many clinical laboratories do not test for non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), such as STEC O26, O103, O45, O111, O121 or O145 because it is harder to identify. Infections with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli can result in dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2-8 days (3-4 days, on average) after exposure to the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5 and older adults. Symptoms of HUS may include fever, abdominal pain, pale skin tone, fatigue, small, unexplained bruises or bleeding from the nose and mouth, decreased urination, and swelling. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

Consumers and media with questions regarding the recall should contact the company’s plant manager Jon Gorea at (315) 768-7100, ext. 228.

The test result showed that the sample contained gluten, but it was not declared on the food label. The CFS has informed the vendor concerned of the irregularity and instructed it to stop sale and remove from shelves the affected batch of product.

Creamery Honeycomb ice cream and L.A. Creamery Salted Caramel ice cream with expiration dates of March 18, 2017, because they were produced in a co-packing facility that has the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.

No illnesses have been reported to date, and no L.A. Creamery product has been found to be contaminated.

This voluntary action is being undertaken because of impacted sugar from a supplier.
Foodborne foreign objects that are not hard and sharp and less than or equal to 7mm in length may cause minor injuries such as temporary reflexive choking and irritation of the gastrointestinal system. There have been no reports of adverse reactions or injuries due to consumption of these products to date.
An initial recall was issued on July 7, 2016 after a ConAgra employee observed metal fragments while dispensing sugar from a supplier for a P.F. Chang’s Home Menu Brand sauce ingredient. On July 14, 2016, ConAgra Foods was notified by the supplier of additional production lots of sugar that were impacted, such that the initial recall needed to be expanded to include additional P.F. Chang’s Home Menu Brand meals.
Products covered by this recall were distributed in the U.S., specific product names and information are listed below. No other ConAgra Foods are impacted by this recall and these products are not served in P.F. Chang’s restaurants. Meals in P.F. Chang’s restaurants are made fresh every day and in every restaurant.
Consumers who have purchased these items are advised not to consume them and return them to the store where originally purchased. ConAgra Foods is cooperating with both the FDA and USDA on this recall and is working with customers to ensure the packages are removed from store shelves and are no longer distributed. Consumers with questions should call our Consumer Affairs hotline at 1-800-252-0634, open 9 am through 7 pm CDT, Monday through Friday.

2753,2017,5,3,us,Imported Frozen Raw Tuna (Ahi) Cubes Distributed on Oahu Test Positive for Hepatitis A; Voluntary Product Recall Underway,"The Hawaii State Department of Health (DOH) has been notified of imported frozen raw tuna or ahi cubes distributed by Tropic Fish Hawaii, LLC on Oahu that tested positive for hepatitis A. The product, imported from Indonesia, was used to prepare poke sold between April 27 – May 1 by food establishments on Oahu.
The imported frozen fish was used to prepare poke sold at Times Supermarket and Shima’s locations in Aiea, Kailua, Kaneohe, Kunia, Liliha, Mililani, Waipahu, and Waimanalo. The product was also used to prepare food served or sold by GP Hawaiian Food Catering, the Crab Shack Kapolei (also known as Maile Sunset Bar & Grill in Kapolei), Aloha Sushi at 3131 N. Nimitz, and the ABC store at 205 Lewers St. Customers who purchased and consumed the product and are not vaccinated for hepatitis A are advised to consult with their doctor about vaccination.
“Times Supermarket and Tropic Fish notified the department as soon as they learned of the test results on the imported fish,” said Peter Oshiro, chief of the DOH Food Safety Program. “All of the product is being traced, collected and held by the distributor. Fortunately, in this case, Tropic Fish Hawaii kept excellent records and has been contacting all retailers and pulling the product quickly.”
“Because it generally takes two weeks for those infected to develop symptoms of hepatitis A, vaccination or immune globulin can still provide some protection against the disease for those who may have been exposed in the last week,” said Dr. Sarah Park, state epidemiologist. “We remind those who received their first dose of hepatitis A vaccination during an earlier outbreak on Oahu to obtain their second dose for long term immunity.”
Persons who consumed poke from the affected food establishments between April 28 and May 1 may have been exposed to hepatitis A and are advised to:
Symptoms of hepatitis A infection usually appear 2–6 weeks after exposure and include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, abdominal discomfort, dark urine, diarrhea, and yellow skin and eyes. Individuals, including food service employees, exhibiting symptoms of hepatitis A should stay home and contact their healthcare provider.
Testing of individuals who do not have symptoms of hepatitis A is not recommended, with the exception of food handlers who have been exposed to the disease, as required by Hawaii State law. Hepatitis A vaccine or IG, if indicated, should be administered after results of the testing are received.
DOH is working with the distributor and visiting all affected facilities to ensure proper sanitation and decontamination procedures are taken. The product is embargoed by the state until further testing is determined and coordination with federal authorities is completed.
While vaccination provides the best protection, frequent handwashing with soap and water after using the bathroom, changing a diaper, and before preparing food can help prevent the spread of hepatitis A. Appropriately cooking foods can also help to prevent infection.
Additional information about hepatitis A is at http://health.hawaii.gov/docd/disease_listing/hepatitis-a/.

The recall is for approximately 100,000 cases of Weight Watchers Smart Ones Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Sundae frozen desserts.
No other sizes, varieties or code dates of Weight Watchers Smart Ones products are included in this recall.

2065,2016,2,8,us,Living Tree Community Foods Recalls Macadamia Nuts and Macadamia Butter Because of Possible Health Risk,"Living Tree Community Foods of Berkeley, California is recalling Organic Macadamia Nuts and Organic Macadamia Butter, because it has the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
Organic Macadamia Nuts and Organic Macadamia Butter were distributed throughout the US via retail stores (California, Connecticut) and to mail order customers.
Living Tree Community Foods Organic Macadamia Nuts come in a 4 oz, clear plastic pouch marked with lot #153442 on the top. Living Tree Community Foods Organic Macadamia Butter comes in an 8 oz glass jar, with a Living Tree Community label on it. Affected lot #s were 134415, 136215, 101716. The UPC Code is: 641432000987. These items shipped from our facility between 12/11/2015 and 2/03/2016.
No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem.
The potential for contamination was noted after FDA testing done with our supplier, Mahina Mele, based in Captain Cook, Hawaii, revealed the presence of Salmonella in organic macadamia nuts.
Production of the product has been suspended while FDA and the company continue their investigation as to the source of the problem.
Consumers who have purchased 4 oz pouch of Organic Macadamia Nuts and 8 oz jars of Organic Macadamia Butter are urged to not consume and return them to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact the company at 1-510-526-7106.

The product in question was shipped to retailers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia under the Country Fresh and store brand labels described in the product listing.
The product bears “BEST IF USED BY” dates between August 7, 2016 (8/7/16) through August 19, 2016 (8/19/16).  The product is in either a clear plastic container as labeled below or in Styrofoam trays overwrapped with clear plastic film as labeled below.  No products except those on this list are subject to this recall.

“We are treating this incident very seriously because we want to ensure that our customers are provided with only the safest, most wholesome, and high-quality products available,” said Max Payen, Country Fresh’s Director of Food Safety.  The potential for contamination was uncovered as the result of a single routine sample taken at a retail store by the Georgia Department of Agriculture, which revealed the finished product tested positive for the bacteria.  The company has ceased distribution of the affected product as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Country Fresh continue their investigation as to what caused the problem.  This recall is being undertaken with the knowledge of the FDA.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

3240,2018,3,17,us,Oregon Food Bank Voluntarily Recalls Pumpkin Seeds Because Of Possible Contamination By Listeria Species,"As a result of the ongoing recall of donated chia seeds that began on March 12, 2018, Oregon Food Bank has initiated a voluntary recall of 63,825 pounds of pumpkin seeds received on the same donation. These donated pumpkin seeds have the potential to be contaminated with Listeria species. While no illnesses have been reported we are recalling this product out of an abundance of caution.
The pumpkin seeds were distributed in Oregon and Clark County, Washington through the Oregon Food Bank Network of regional food banks and participating food pantries. The product was distributed in one pound plastic poly film bags with a twist-type closure or a re-sealable pouch or a KALE JOY plastic bag. All pumpkin seeds were distributed between November 1, 2017 and March 16, 2018. See attached images for ease of identification.
Listeria species can include Listeria monocytogenes an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria monocytogenes infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. Anyone who has consumed these pumpkin seeds and is experiencing symptoms of food borne illness should consult with their primary physician or county health department.
Individuals should dispose of the product immediately. Any questions should be directed to Oregon Food Bank's Facilities and Regulatory Compliance Manager Ryan Wist at 503-419-4160.

1286,2012,10,22,us,Hawaii Firm Recalls Ground Beef Products Due To Possible E. Coli O157:H7 Contamination,"WASHINGTON, October 22, 2012 - Higa Meat & Pork Market, a Honolulu, HI establishment, is recalling approximately 4,100 pounds of ground beef products that may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.
The following products are subject to recall:10-lb. bags of ""HIGA MARKET-GROUND BEEF BULK"" - 1 to 6 bags per carton/case.




PREPARING GROUND BEEF FOR SAFE CONSUMPTION


Wash hands before and after handling raw meat with warm/hot (preferred) or cold soapy running water by rubbing hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds. Also wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot (preferred), soapy water and clean up any spills right away. The mechanical action of vigorous rubbing of hands and utensils/surfaces creates friction that helps to dislodge bacteria and viruses from hands and surfaces.
Additionally, warm/hot water helps to dissolve fats/foods, aiding in cleaning/microbe removal and can also assist in deactivation of pathogens. For more information on hand washing, go to http://www.cdc.gov/
handwashing . If soapy water is not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can reduce the number of germs on hands in some situations. However, sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs, including viruses.
Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be thoroughly cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry, and their juices and thoroughly cooked foods. Thoroughly cook ground meat such as beef to an internal temperature of 160° F, as measured with a food thermometer, before eating. Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase (one hour if temperatures exceed 90° F). Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.





Each case bears the establishment number ""EST. 12457M"" inside the USDA mark of inspection, as well as the identifying case code number: ""291."" The products were produced on Oct. 17, 2012 and were distributed to restaurants in the Oahu, HI area.
The problem was discovered by FSIS and occurred as a result of the products testing positive for E. coli O157:H7 and being shipped prior to the company receiving test results. FSIS and the company have received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of these products. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact a healthcare provider.
FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers (including restaurants) of the recall and to ensure that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration, and in the most severe cases, kidney failure. The very young, seniors and persons with weak immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness.
FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature.
Consumers and media with questions regarding the recall should contact the company's Vice President, Sheldon Wright, at (808) 531-3591.",biological,"meat, egg and dairy products",escherichia coli,ground beef

FDA analysis has found the product to contain undeclared sibutramine and fluoxetine. Sibutramine was an FDA-approved drug used as an appetite suppressant for weight loss but was withdrawn from the market because of safety issues, including stroke, heart failure and serious health risk especially to those with underlying heart related disease. Fluoxetine is an FDA approved drug indicated for the treatment of various depressive disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, bulimia and panic disorders. This drug product carries a box warning for suicidal thoughts and behaviors and it needs to be monitored closely by a prescriber. The presence of sibutramine and fluoxetine in Imperia Elita Vitaccino coffee renders it an unapproved drug for which safety and efficacy has not been established and therefore subject to a recall.

914,2009,1,28,us,2009 - peanut corporation of america expands nationwide recall of peanut products,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- Lynchburg, Va. (January 28, 2009) – Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) is voluntarily recalling all peanuts and peanut products processed in its Blakely, Georgia facility since Jan. 1, 2007. Previously, PCA announced a recall of peanut butter and peanut paste. PCA sells its products to institutional and industrial users for service in large institutions or for sale and further processing by other companies. PCA does not sell peanuts or peanut products directly to consumers in stores.
PCA is not aware of any complaints or reports of illness involving the additional peanuts and peanut products subject to this expanded recall. PCA is acting out of an abundance of caution and with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s help to recall all products manufactured in its Georgia facility. PCA is voluntarily taking this larger recall action following almost two weeks of inspection and review at the Georgia facility.
The expanded recall includes all peanuts (dry and oil roasted), granulated peanuts, peanut meal, peanut butter and peanut paste. All of the recalled peanuts and peanut products were made only at the company’s Blakely, Georgia facility; the lot numbers and a description of the products being recalled are listed at the end of this release. The Blakely, Georgia facility has stopped producing all peanut products.
The voluntary recall comes amid an FDA investigation into a nationwide salmonella outbreak that has sickened more than 500 people nationwide beginning in September, with the largest number of illnesses reported in November. Salmonella is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
Because some of our peanut products have been used by manufacturers of pet food, we are also alerting the public that Salmonella is an organism that can potentially be transferred to people handling pet treats exposed to Salmonella, especially if they have not thoroughly washed their hands after having contact with the products or any surfaces exposed to these products. Pets with Salmonella infections may be lethargic and have diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, fever, and vomiting. Some pets will have only decreased appetite, fever and abdominal pain. Well animals can be carriers and infect other animals or humans. If your pet has consumed the recalled product and has these symptoms, please contact your veterinarian.
The potential for contamination was noted after samples from peanut butter containers and environmental samples from the Blakely, Georgia facility tested positive for Salmonella. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said the investigation is “very active and dynamic,” and PCA continues to work closely with the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as they continue their investigation into the nationwide outbreak of Salmonella.
PCA is notifying customers who received recalled products by phone and/or in writing. Customers should segregate and hold the product and call PCA at 1-877-564-7080 for further instructions. Consumers should contact the FDA and visit the agency web site at www.fda.gov for a complete list of all products affected.
“We have been devastated by this, and we have been working around the clock with the FDA to ensure any potentially unsafe products are removed from the market immediately,” said Stewart Parnell, President of Peanut Corporation of America. “Additionally, we are working alongside state and federal food safety experts in every way we can to help them protect consumers, both now and in the future.
“We want our customers and consumers to know that PCA is taking extraordinary measures, out of an abundance of caution, to identify and recall all products that have been identified as potential risks.”
The recalled peanuts and peanut products were distributed nationwide to institutions, food service industries, and private label food companies as well as and in Canada, Haiti, Korea and Trinidad.
All lots that are affected begin with the lot number 7, 8 or 9. The following is the description of the products being recalled:
Description:  Peanut Butter All Styles All Sizes All Lots beginning with 7, 8, or 9 Peanut Paste All Styles All Sizes All Lots beginning with 7,8, or 9 Peanut Meal All Styles All Sizes All lots beginning with 7, 8, or 9 Peanut Granules All Styles All Sizes All lots beginning with 7, 8 or 9 Peanuts All Styles All Sizes All lots beginning with 7, 8 or 9",biological,"nuts, nut products and seeds",salmonella,peanuts

3682,2018,10,25,us,Urgent: Curry Spice Recall,"This is to inform you of a product recall involving: HOT CURRY POWER & CURRY POWDER, BARAKA, 7.0 oz PLASTIC JAR UPC CODES 822514265566 AND 822514265535 RESPECTIVELY
This voluntary recall has been initiated by UBC Food Distributors Inc, due to a high level of lead found in the product after testing was done by the Michigan Department of Agriculture & Rural Development, which found high traces of lead. This product was purchased from an importer, who, along with the FDA, are now in the process of contacting the source, so that corrective action can be taken on their part. Use of, or consumption of this product may elevate lead levels in the blood.
Lead is a toxic substance present in our environment in small amounts and everyone is exposed to some lead from daily actions such as inhaling dust, eating food, or drinking water. In general, the small exposure to lead within the U.S. population does not pose a significant public health concern. However, exposure to larger amounts of lead can cause lead poisoning. While lead can affect nearly every bodily system, its effects depend upon the amount and duration of lead exposure and age. Symptoms can include abdominal pain, vomiting, lethargy, irritability, weakness, behavior or mood changes, delirium, seizures, and coma. However, infants, young children and the developing fetus can be affected by chronic exposure to amounts of lead that may not result in obvious symptoms of lead poisoning. A child with lead poisoning may not look or act sick. Lead poisoning in children can cause: learning disabilities, developmental delays, and lower IQ scores.
Less than 20 cases of this product were shipped between June 15 and July 31 2018 to the following areas in the USA: Michigan, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Missouri and Colorado. We ask that all products with the Baraka Brand and UPC CODES 822514265566 AND 822514265535 be removed from shelfs and placed aside for pick up from a UBC company representative.
Your notification must include instructions on what customers should do with the recalled product. Please ask consumers to cease use of product, immediately return any unused portions to your outlet. You will then need to quarantine the items for pick up by an authorized person from our company.
This recall should be carried out to the consumer level. Your assistance is appreciated and necessary to prevent and avoid any potential illness.
If you have any questions, call UBC Customer Care toll free M-F between 9am and 6pm EST, or email anytime, at 877-846-8117, or email at: customerservice@wellmadefood.com

Various sizes of shell eggs are packaged in the following ways: 6-count cartons, 10-count cartons, 12-count cartons, 18-count cartons, 15 dozen cases, and 30 dozen cases. The dates and codes on the cartons and cases will include everything prior to and including date code 006 - Sell By 02/05/2016, under the brand name Good Earth Egg Company, license number D-01124.

Therefore, FSIS prohibits SRMs from use as human food to minimize potential human exposure to the BSE agent.

Although the product(s) being recalled should be returned to the point of purchase, consumers preparing other ground beef products should heed the following advice.
                                              
Consumers should only eat ground beef patties that have been cooked to a safe temperature of 160 °F. When a ground beef patty is cooked to 160 °F throughout, it can be safe and juicy, regardless of color.
                                              
The only way to be sure a ground beef patty is cooked to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use an accurate food thermometer.
                                              
Color is not a reliable indicator that ground beef patties have been cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria such as  
                                              E. coli O157:H7.
                                              
Eating a pink or red ground beef patty without first verifying that the safe temperature of 160 °F has been reached is a significant risk factor for foodborne illness.
                                              
Thermometer use to ensure proper cooking temperature is especially important for those who cook or serve ground beef patties to people most at risk for foodborne illness because  
                                              E. coli O157:H7 can lead to serious illness or even death. Those most at risk include young children, seniors, and those with compromised immune systems.

1914,2015,9,8,us,Schrader Farms Meat Market Recalls Beef Product Due To Possible Non-O157 E. Coli Contamination,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 08, 2015 – Schrader Farms Meat Market, a Romulus, N.Y., establishment, is recalling approximately 20 pounds of ground beef product that may be contaminated with non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The ground beef item was produced on September 2, 2015. The following product is subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF only)]

1-lb. packages containing of “SCHRADER FARMS Meat Market Ground Beef” or “SCHRADER FARMS Meat Market GROUND BEEF, BULK” with a pack date of September 2, 2015.
The products subject to recall bear the establishment number “Est. 44950” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These products were sold at the Schrader Farms retail store in Seneca County, New York.

The problem was discovered during routine establishment testing, however this establishment released product into commerce prematurely (Review of Testing Results). FSIS and the company have received no reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.

Many clinical laboratories do not test for non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), such as STEC O26, O103, O45, O111, O121 or O145 because it is harder to identify than STEC O157. People can become ill from STECs 2–8 days (average of 3–4 days) after consuming the organism. Most people infected with non-STEC E. coli develop diarrhea (often bloody), and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment; antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended.

Most people recover within a week, but, rarely, some develop a more severe infection. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is uncommon with STEC O26, O103, O45, O111, O121 or O145 infection. HUS can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old, older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F.

937,2009,2,4,us,"2009 - rich ice cream company, inc. issues multi-state voluntary recall of rich's nutty sundae cone because of possible health risk","FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- (West Palm Beach, FL – February 4, 2009) – Rich Ice Cream Company, Inc. voluntarily recalled its Rich’s Nutty Sundae Cone on January 30, 2009, because the product has the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella. This action is the result of the Peanut Corporation of America’s expanded recall on January 28, 2009, for all products manufactured in their Blakely, Georgia facility since January 1, 2007.
Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.  For more information on Salmonella, please visit the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s website at www.cdc.gov.
Rich’s Nutty Sundae Cone is distributed in AL, CA, DE, DC, FL, GA, IL, IN, KS, KY, LA, MD, MA, MI, MS, MO, NV, NH, NJ, NY, NC, OH, OK, PA, PR, SC, TN, TX, VI, VA, Bahamas, and Barbados in bulk packages of 24, and sold to consumers in a 3 fl. oz., cone-shaped package with UPC 75455-42000 printed on the individual package.
Rich Ice Cream has received no reports of illnesses related to our product to date.  No other products manufactured by Rich Ice Cream are involved in this recall.   
Because Rich’s Nutty Sundae Cone is typically consumed at the point of sale, it is unlikely that consumers will have the product on hand in their homes.  However, if for some reason consumers have the product at home, they are instructed to dispose of it.

3565,2018,9,1,us,J.T.M. Provisions Company Recalls Cooked Ground Beef Products  Due To Possible Listeria Contamination,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 31, 2018 – J.T.M. Provisions Co., a Harrison, Ohio establishment, is recalling approximately 960 pounds of cooked ground beef patty products that may be adulterated with Listeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The cooked, ready-to-eat beef patty crumble items were produced on May 17, 2018. The following products are subject to recall:[View Labels (PDF only)]

20-lb. cases containing four 5-lb sealed pouches of “COOKED BEEF PATTY CRUMBLES” with case code “47860” and a Julian date of “18137.”
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 1917” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to distribution centers located in California.       

FSIS inspection program personnel discovered the problem on August 31, 2018 during routine inspection duties. The product was tested by the establishment and found to be positive for L. monocytogenes under their sampling program.

There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers’ refrigerators or freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Joe Maas, JTM Provisions Co. owner, at (513) 367-4900.

The trade should stop using or selling the affected batches of the product concerned immediately if they possess it. Product details are as follows: Product name: Smoked Norwegian Salmon Slices with Dill Place of origin: Hong Kong Net weight: 100 grams per pack Use-by date: All batches on or after June 25, 2022 Distributor: Polyfood Food Service Co. Ltd. The spokesman said, ""The CFS collected the above-mentioned smoked salmon sample from an online shop for testing under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The test result showed the presence of Listeria monocytogenes in 25 grams of the sample, exceeding the standard of the Microbiological Guidelines for Food which states that Listeria monocytogenes should not be detected in 25 grams of food."" The spokesman said that the CFS has informed the manufacturer concerned of the test result and instructed it to stop sale and remove from shelves the affected product, and initiate a recall. For enquiries about the recall, members of the public may call the manufacturer at 2898 9962/6366 0067 during office hours. ""Listeria monocytogenes can be easily destroyed by cooking but can survive and multiply at refrigerator temperature. Most healthy individuals do not develop symptoms or only have mild symptoms like fever, muscle pain, headache, nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea when infected. However, severe complications such as septicaemia, meningitis or even death may occur in newborns, the elderly and those with a weaker immune system. Although infected pregnant women may just experience mild symptoms generally, the infection of Listeria monocytogenes may cause miscarriage, infant death, preterm birth, or severe infection in newborns,"" the spokesman said. The spokesman urged consumers not to consume the affected product if they have bought any. The trade should also stop using or selling the product concerned immediately if they possess it. The CFS visited the concerned production facilities immediately for investigation and instructed the management to perform cleansing and disinfection. The CFS will alert the trade to the incident, and will continue to follow up and take appropriate action. Investigation is ongoing.

5972,2021,11,10,us,Ellenos Real Greek Issues Allergy Alert on Undeclared Egg in Mango Greek Yogurt 16 oz. Cup,"November 10th, 2021, Ellenos Real Greek Yogurt of Federal Way, WA is recalling Mango Greek Yogurt 16 oz. cups because it may contain undeclared egg. People who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to egg run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume this product.

Mango Greek Yogurt 16 oz. cups were distributed in Oregon and Washington through select retail stores.

The Mango Greek Yogurt 16 oz cup has the UPC 8 57290 00612 6 and has the affected BEST BEFORE date of 11/28/2021 printed on a blue foil seal.  This is a refrigerated item and packaged in a clear plastic container with a blue foil seal and can be identified by the blue lettering on front panel display. No other Ellenos brand yogurt products of any other size or similarity were affected. 

No illnesses or deaths have been reported to date.

The recall was initiated when a few 16oz cups containing dark brown puree instead of bright yellow Mango puree were discovered. After a full internal investigation, it was determined that Mango yogurt cups were inadvertently used and packed with pumpkin yogurt product. The Mango yogurt cup label does not declare egg.

This recall is being made with the knowledge of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

John Tucker, the CEO of Ellenos stated: “We learned today of the mislabeling and immediately contacted the FDA, our distributors, and retail partners of the mislabel and to notify of an immediate recall of 16oz Mango. We take the health and safety of our consumers incredibly seriously and wanted to remove mislabeled product from the market as soon as possible.”

Consumers with an egg allergy or sensitivity who have purchased the affected product are urged not to consume the product and should dispose of it or return it to their place of purchase for a full refund.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

The illness often begins suddenly. Even after having the illness, you can still become re-infected by norovirus. The main symptoms of norovirus illness are diarrhea, vomiting (children usually experience more vomiting than adults), nausea and stomach cramps. Other symptoms may include low-grade fever, headache, chills, muscle aches and fatigue (a general sense of tiredness).  Most people feel better within one or two days, with symptoms resolving on their own, and experience no long-term health effects. As with any illness causing diarrhea or vomiting, people who are ill should drink plenty of liquids to replace lost body fluids and prevent dehydration. In severe cases, patients may need to be hospitalized and given fluids intravenously.

935,2009,2,4,us,2009 - Fieldbrook Foods Corporation Adds Four Products to Nationwide Voluntary Recall of Select Ice Cream Novelty Products Due to Possible Health Risk,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- Dunkirk, NY – February 4, 2009 – Fieldbrook Foods Corporation announced an update to the January 29, 2009 voluntary nationwide recall of select ice cream novelty products containing granulated peanuts as the products have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella.
Salmonella is an organism, which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e. infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. For more information on Salmonella, please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Website at http://www.cdc.gov .
The FDA and other regulatory agencies have been investigating Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) due to a recent Salmonella outbreak associated with various peanut products.  The FDA has advised that all products produced by PCA from its Blakely, Georgia facility are subject to recall, including granulated peanuts.  Fieldbrook utilized granulated peanuts from PCA for the topping on various ice cream sundae cone products.  Fieldbrook is consequently recalling the ice cream sundae cone products that contain recalled granulated peanuts from PCA. 
The company has not received any complaints of consumer illnesses associated with these products. 
The products listed below have been distributed nationwide to retail and food service distribution centers as well as Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.
The four additional items are as follows:
The following is a complete list of products affected by the recall.  All lots prior to the code date listed are subject to the recall:
“Our number one priority is consumer safety,” stated Kenneth Johnson, President and CEO, Fieldbrook Foods Corp.  “Our actions are intended to remove all potentially contaminated products and eliminate any associated risks to consumers.”
Consumers who have purchased the recalled products should either destroy or return them to the place of purchase for a full refund.  Questions may be directed to the company Monday – Friday at 1-800-333-0805 between the hours of 9AM and 4PM EST.

2420,2016,9,9,us,"Paradise Valley Market, Inc. (Carnival Supermarket) Recalls Ground Beef Productsdue To Possible E. Coli O157:H7 Adulteration","WASHINGTON, Sept. 8, 2016 – The Paradise Valley Market, Inc. (Carnival Supermarket), located at 870 3rd Avenue, Chula Vista, Calif., is voluntarily recalling approximately 35 pounds of ground beef products that may be adulterated with E. coli O157:H7, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The lean and extra lean ground beef was produced and sold only on Sept. 1, 2016. The following products are subject to recall:

20-lbs. of 15% lean ground beef product. The product would have been packaged to order and sold at the Carnival Supermarket meat counter in reddish plastic bags with a tied knot at the top.

15-lbs. of 7% extra lean ground beef product. The product would have been packaged to order and sold at the Carnival Supermarket meat counter in reddish plastic bags with a tied knot at the top.
The problem was discovered when FSIS received notification that a product sample collected at the firm tested positive for E. coli O157:H7. There have been no confirmed reports of illness or adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.

E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2–8 days (3–4 days, on average) after exposure the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS and the company issued the voluntary recall over concerns that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume product that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can call Sandy Young, Vice President of J. Walcher Communications, at (619) 295-7140.

Consumers with food safety questions can ""Ask Karen,"" the FSIS virtual representative available 24 hours a day at AskKaren.gov or via smartphone at m.askkaren.gov. The toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline 1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854) is available in English and Spanish and can be reached from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday. Recorded food safety messages are available 24 hours a day. The online Electronic Consumer Complaint Monitoring System can be accessed 24 hours a day at: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/reportproblem.

Wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw meat and poultry. Wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot, soapy water. Immediately clean spills.

Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry and egg products and cooked foods.

Color is NOT a reliable indicator that meat has been cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria.

The only way to be sure the meat or poultry is cooked to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use a thermometer to measure the internal temperature.

- Fish: 145°F
- Beef, pork, lamb chops/steaks/roasts: 145°F with a three minute rest time
- Ground meat: 160°F
- Poultry: 165°F
- Hot dogs: 160°F or steaming hot

Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase or one hour if temperatures exceed 90º F. Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.",biological,"meat, egg and dairy products",escherichia coli,ground beef

Although the product(s) being recalled should be returned to the point of purchase, consumers preparing other ground beef products should heed the following advice.
                                              
Consumers should only eat ground beef patties that have been cooked to a safe temperature of 160 °F. When a ground beef patty is cooked to 160 °F throughout, it can be safe and juicy, regardless of color.
                                              
The only way to be sure a ground beef patty is cooked to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use an accurate food thermometer.
                                              
Color is not a reliable indicator that ground beef patties have been cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria such as  
                                              E. coli O157:H7.
                                              
Eating a pink or red ground beef patty without first verifying that the safe temperature of 160 °F has been reached is a significant risk factor for foodborne illness.
                                              
Thermometer use to ensure proper cooking temperature is especially important for those who cook or serve ground beef patties to people most at risk for foodborne illness because  
                                              E. coli O157:H7 can lead to serious illness or even death. Those most at risk include young children, seniors, and those with compromised immune systems.

Coli O157:H7 Contamination,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 16, 2018 – Majestic Meat Company, a Salt Lake City, Utah establishment, is recalling approximately 532 pounds of ground beef products that may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The bulk ground beef, ground beef patties, and meatballs were produced on November 8, 2018. The product list can be found here: [View Labels (PDF only)]

The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 19915” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to restaurants in the state of Utah.

The problem was discoveredon November 15, 2018 when FSIS identified that product associated with a sample that confirmed positive forE. coliO157:H7 had been shipped. The establishment held 2 of the 3 boxes of source material associated with the sampled product, however, the third box of source material was further processed and shipped.There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.

Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider. E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2–8 days (3–4 days, on average) after exposure the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground that has been cooked to a temperature of 165°F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

Sometimes foods have to be withdrawn or recalled if there is a risk to consumers because the allergy labelling is missing or incorrect or if there is any other food allergy risk. When there is a food allergy risk, the FSA will issue an Allergy Alert. Get Allergy Alerts: Sign up to get the latest FSA Allergy Alerts.

1342,2013,3,2,us,Michigan Firm Recalls Ham Products That Were Produced Without A HACCP Plan,"WASHINGTON, Mar. 2, 2013 - Byron Center Wholesale Meats, a Byron Center, Michigan, establishment, is recalling approximately 6,586 pounds of ham products that were produced without a Hazard Analysis & Critical Control Points (HACCP) plan, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.
The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels]Various weight packages of ""Seven Sons Family Farms & Co."" Diced Ham (fully cooked), Smoked Ham Sliced (ready to cook/fully cooked) and Smoked Ham Roast (ready to cook/fully cooked).

Various weight packages of ""Heffron Farms"" Diced Ham (ready to cook), Smoked Ham Sliced (ready to cook), Smoked Ham Roast(ready to cook), Ground Ham Smoked Pork, Smoked Ham Hocks (ready to cook) and Picnic Hams (ready to cook).

Various weight packages of ""Byron Center Meats"" Semi Boneless Ham (ready to cook), Canadian Bacon (not fully cooked), Smoked Ham Hocks, Smoked Pork Chops (ready to cook) and Smoked Picnic Hams.

The recalled products bear the establishment number ""Est. 2592"" inside the USDA mark of inspection. The products were produced prior to March 1, 2013, and were distributed in Michigan and Indiana.
The problem was discovered when an FSIS inspector observed establishment personnel making diced and sliced ham products from whole hams. These hams were labeled as fully cooked, but the company does not have a HACCP plan for fully cooked product or a Listeria control program. Further investigation revealed other Ready-To-Eat and heat-treated products produced without HACCP plans. HACCP plans, in which establishments identify potential hazards associated with a given product, and identify a means of addressing those hazards in the production process, are required for all products.
FSIS and the company have received no reports of illness at this time. Anyone concerned about an illness from consumption of these products should contact a healthcare provider. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify that recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

Recommendations for people at risk for Listeriosis
Wash hands with warm, soapy water before and after handling raw meat and poultry for at least 20 seconds. Wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot, soapy water. Immediately clean spills.
Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry and egg products and cooked foods.
Do not eat hot dogs, luncheon meats, bologna or other deli meats unless reheated until steaming hot.
Do not eat refrigerated paté, meat spreads from a meat counter or smoked seafood found in the refrigerated section of the store. Foods that don't need refrigeration, like canned tuna and canned salmon, are safe to eat. Refrigerate after opening.
Do not drink raw (unpasteurized) milk and do not eat foods that have unpasteurized milk in them.
Do not eat salads made in the store such as ham salad, chicken salad, egg salad, tuna salad or seafood salad.
Do not eat soft cheeses such as Feta, quesco blanco, quesco fresco, Brie, Camembert cheeses, blue-veined cheeses and Panela unless it is labeled as made with pasteurized milk.
Use precooked or ready-to-eat food as soon as you can. Listeria can grow in the refrigerator. The refrigerator should be 40° F or lower and the freezer 0° F or lower. Use an appliance thermometer to check the temperature of your refrigerator.

Check to see if you have recalled products in your home. Recalled products should be thrown out or returned to the store where they were purchased. People with norovirus illness usually develop symptoms of gastroenteritis within 24 to 48 hours, but symptoms can start as early as 12 hours after exposure. The illness often begins suddenly. Even after having the illness, you can still become re-infected by norovirus. The main symptoms of norovirus illness are diarrhea, vomiting (children usually experience more vomiting than adults), nausea and stomach cramps. Other symptoms may include low-grade fever, headache, chills, muscle aches and fatigue (a general sense of tiredness).  Most people feel better within one or two days, with symptoms resolving on their own, and experience no long-term health effects. As with any illness causing diarrhea or vomiting, people who are ill should drink plenty of liquids to replace lost body fluids and prevent dehydration. In severe cases, patients may need to be hospitalized and given fluids intravenously.

1137,2011,12,15,us,Northeastern Grocery Chain Recalls Ground Beef Products Due To Possible Salmonella Contamination,"WASHINGTON, Dec. 15, 2011 - Hannaford, a Scarborough, Maine-based grocery chain, is recalling an undetermined amount of fresh ground beef products that may be contaminated with a strain of  
                                  Salmonella Typhimurium, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.
                                  
 The products subject to recall are any size package of the following:
                                  ""73% Hannaford Regular Ground Beef""
                                     ""75% Hannaford Regular Ground Beef""

                                     ""90% Hannaford Regular Ground Beef""

                                     ""90% Nature's Place Ground Beef""
                                  
 This recall was initiated due to concerns about illnesses caused by an outbreak of salmonellosis that may be associated with use and consumption of fresh in-store ground beef prepared in and purchased at Hannaford stores. The PFGE pattern associated with this outbreak is reported rarely in the U.S. The  
                                  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reported 14 ill persons with an indistinguishable PFGE pattern, and 11 of those individuals reported consuming ground beef. Seven individuals were hospitalized and no deaths have been reported. Ten of the 14 case-patients reported purchasing ground beef at Hannaford stores in Maine, New York, New Hampshire and Vermont between Oct. 12 and Nov. 20. No other product description is available at this time. As a result of on-going epidemiologic and traceback investigations, as well as in-store reviews, FSIS, working with the CDC and its state health partners, determined that there is a link between the Hannaford ground beef products and this illness outbreak. FSIS is continuing to work with CDC, public health partners in the affected states and the company on the investigation. FSIS will continue to provide information as it becomes available.
                                  
 The various ground beef packages bear sell-by dates of Dec. 17, 2011 or earlier and were sold at Hannaford stores throughout Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Vermont. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on FSIS' website at: www.fsis.usda.gov/FSIS_Recalls

This outbreak strain of  
                                              Salmonella is resistant to many commonly prescribed antibiotics and its resistance can increase the risk of hospitalization or possible treatment failure in infected individuals.
                                              
Wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw meat and poultry. Also wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot soapy water. Clean up spills right away.
                                              
Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry and egg products and cooked foods.
                                              
Cook raw meat and poultry to safe internal temperatures before eating. The safe internal temperature for meat such as beef and pork is 160° F, and 165° F for poultry, as determined with a food thermometer.
                                              
Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase (one hour if temperatures exceed 90° F). Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.
                                            
                                          
                                                                               
                                                                            
                                    
 The outbreak strain of  
                                  Salmonella Typhimurium has initially tested resistant to multiple commonly prescribed antibiotics, including drug classes such as beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and cephalosporins. Additional information on drug resistance will be made public as it becomes available.
                                  
 Based on an examination of Hannaford's limited records, FSIS was unable to determine responsible suppliers. FSIS recently identified this problem at the retail level and is pursuing rulemaking to address the concern. This recall is being issued as part of a continuing investigation. FSIS has not yet been able to identify FSIS-regulated suppliers of raw beef ground at Hannaford Stores related to the outbreak that could be subject to recall action.
                                  
 Consumption of food contaminated with  
                                  Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses.  
                                  Salmonella infections can be life-threatening, especially to those with weak immune systems, such as infants, the elderly, and persons with HIV infection or those undergoing chemotherapy. The most common manifestations of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours. Additional symptoms may be chills, headache, nausea and vomiting that can last up to seven days. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact a health care provider.
                                  
 FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature.
                                  
 Customers who have questions are encouraged to call the Hannaford Customer Information Center, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. at (800) 213-9040, and choose option 6.

The 12 salads are in addition to the 12 oz. Hy-Vee Bagged Garden Salad product that Hy-Vee pulled last week after initial notification of the investigation. Hy-Vee now has 13 private label bagged salad products (all expiration dates) that are being recalled as a result.

During an FDA inspection, samples collected tested positive for Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes and resulted in a recall due to the potential health risks to humans and pets.  Bravo Packing, Inc. is expanding the recall due to potential cross contamination. (Full list of products below.) Salmonella can cause illness in pets eating the products, as well as people who handle contaminated pet food products, especially if they have not thoroughly washed their hands after having contact with the products, infected pets, or any surfaces exposed to these products. People infected with Salmonella should monitor themselves for some or all of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and fever. Rarely, Salmonella can result in more serious ailments, including arterial infections, endocarditis (an infection of the heart muscle), arthritis, muscle pain, eye irritation, and urinary tract symptoms. People who have these symptoms after having contact with the products identified in this recall or with a pet that has eaten these products should contact their healthcare providers. A pet with a Salmonella infection may be lethargic and have diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, fever, and vomiting. Some pets will have decreased appetite, fever, and abdominal pain. If your pet has consumed the recalled products and has these symptoms, please contact your veterinarian. Pets exposed to contaminated food can be infected without showing symptoms. Infected pets, including those without symptoms, can also shed Salmonella through their feces and saliva, spreading pathogens into the home environment and to humans and other animals nearby. Listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, Listeria monocytogenes infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. No human or animal illnesses related to the identified products have been reported to date. Bravo Packing Inc. generally works with distributors that fill orders to retail stores and to consumers directly nationwide. Consumers with any of the affected products should handle them with caution, discard products in a secure container, and wash hands and surfaces properly. Consumers with questions should contact Bravo Packing, Inc. at 856-299-1044 (Monday – Friday, 9:00 AM-2:00 PM, EST).

2680,2017,3,3,us,Ohio Farms Packing Co. Ltd. Recalls Veal Products Due To Possible E. Coli O103 Contamination,"WASHINGTON, March 2, 2017 – Ohio Farms Packing Co. Ltd., a Creston, Ohio establishment, is recalling approximately 40,680 pounds of boneless veal products that may be contaminated with E. coli O103, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. Also included in the recall is an undetermined amount of veal cutlets produced by Ohio Farms Packing Co. Ltd. All of the cutlets were sold to food services; none of this product was sold directly to consumers. Companies that purchase products from Ohio Farms Packing Co.

The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 34569” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to distributors in Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas and Canada.

The problem was discovered when FSIS was notified by the Illinois State Department of Agriculture about a positive non-0157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli sample.

There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.

Many clinical laboratories do not test for non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), such as STEC O103 because it is harder to identify than STEC O157. People can become ill from STECs 2–8 days (average of 3–4 days) after consuming the organism. Most people infected with STEC O103 develop diarrhea (often bloody), and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment; antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended.

Most people recover within a week, but, rarely, some develop a more severe infection. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is uncommon with STEC O103 infection. HUS can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old, older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in customer’s freezers.

Customers who have purchased these products are urged not to use them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground veal that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that veal is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature. Safe minimal cooking temperatures can be found at http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

915,2009,1,29,us,2009 - Fieldbrook Foods Corp. Announces Nationwide Voluntary Recall of Select Ice Cream Novelty Products Due to Possible Health Risk,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- Dunkirk, NY – January 29, 2009 – Fieldbrook Foods Corp. announced a voluntary nationwide recall of select ice cream novelty products containing granulated peanuts as the products have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella.
Salmonella is an organism, which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e. infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. For more information on Salmonella, please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Website at http://www.cdc.gov .
The FDA and other regulatory agencies have been investigating Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) due to a recent Salmonella outbreak associated with various peanut products.  The FDA has advised that all products produced by PCA from its Blakely, Georgia facility are subject to recall, including granulated peanuts.  Fieldbrook utilized granulated peanuts from PCA for the topping on various ice cream sundae cone products.
Fieldbrook is recalling the ice cream sundae cone products that contain recalled granulated peanuts from PCA.  The company has not received any complaints of consumer illnesses associated with these products.  The products listed below have been distributed nationwide to retail and food service distribution centers as well as Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.
All lots of the following products are affected by the recall:

The RTE corned beef items were produced on October 4, 2018. The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF only)]

10-lb. boxes containing two 5-lb. packages of “PROCESADORA La Hacienda, Inc. CORNED BEEF, TUBED with “Lot: 10/4/18”, and an expiration date of “Exp. 12/4/18.”
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 21217A” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to institutions in Puerto Rico.

The problem was discovered after the firm received consumer complaints from schools that received the product. While the product was distributed to schools, it resulted from a commercial sale and was not part of food provided by the USDA for the National School Lunch Program.

FSIS has received no reports of injury or illness from consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be in school freezers or refrigerators. School nutrition professionals who have purchased these products are urged not to prepare or consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

4243,2019,8,21,us,"Tip Top Poultry, Inc. Recalls Fully Cooked Poultry Products due to Possible Listeria Contamination","WASHINGTON, August 20, 2019 – Tip Top Poultry, Inc., a Rockmart, Ga. establishment, is recalling approximately 135,810 pounds of fully cooked poultry products that may be adulterated with Listeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The frozen, diced, and mechanically separated ready to eat chicken was produced on January 21, 2019 and display “PACK DATE 01/21/19” on the labels. The products subject to recall can be found in thisspreadsheet.[View labels(PDF only)]

The products subject to recall bear establishment number “P-17453” inside the USDA mark of inspection or on the case. These items were shipped to hotels, restaurants, and institutions nationwide.                

The problem was discovered on August 17, 2019, when the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) notified FSIS that a sample of product produced by Tip Top Poultry, Inc. confirmed positive for the presence of Listeria monocytogenes.

Canadian public health and food safety partners, including the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, have been investigating an outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes. A ready-to-eat diced chicken product collected as part of the investigation tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes. The investigation is ongoing.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms.

An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be in institutional freezers. Institutions who have purchased these products are urged not to serve them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

The product contains anchovies, a known allergen, which is not declared on the product label.

The RTE buffalo-style flank steak beef jerky items were produced July 12, 2021. The following products are subject to recall:

2.25 oz plastic bags containing KINGMADE JERKY BUFFALO STYLE with BEST BY JAN 13 2023 and Lot 071221 located on the back lower half of the bag.

These items were produced for, shipped, and distributed to PGA golf events in Minneapolis, Minn. and Memphis, Tenn. The items are available to PGA tour athletes, trainers, and staff. The items are not available to spectators at the PGA events. The items are not available at any retail locations.

The problem was discovered during routine FSIS label verification activities when it was determined that the labels did not accurately list all sub-ingredients.

There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be at the PGA events. PGA personnel should not serve the product to athletes, trainers, or staffs and should throw the product out or return to the place of purchase.

When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS began monitoring a cluster of E. coli O157:H7 illnesses on Oct. 29, 2013 then was notified by FDA on Nov. 6, 2013 that California authorities had reported case-patients consuming pre-packaged salads with grilled chicken. Working in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), FDA, the California Department of Public Health, the Washington State Department of Health, and the Arizona Department of Health Services, FSIS has determined that there is a link between the grilled chicken salads and the illness cluster. Twenty-six case-patients have been identified in three states with indistinguishable E. coli O157:H7 PFGE (genetic fingerprint) patterns with illness onset dates ranging from Sept 29, 2013 to Oct. 26, 2013. Based on epidemiological information, 15 case-patients reported consumption of ready-to-eat pre-packaged salads prior to illness onset. A traceback investigation determined Glass Onion Catering was the supplier of the products implicated in the outbreak. 

While uncommon to find E. coli O157:H7 in a poultry product, FSIS will continue its investigation in conjunction with the FDA to identify the source of the contamination. FSIS continues to work with the CDC, FDA and state public health partners on this investigation and will provide updated information as it becomes available.

E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2-8 days (3-4 days, on average) after exposure the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some products may be in a consumer’s refrigerators. Because this is a ready-to-eat product, FSIS advises all consumers to destroy the product.

Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Tom Atherstone, company president, at (510) 236-8905.

947,2009,2,26,us,2009 - rich ice cream company expands precautionary voluntary multi-state recall to include rich's candy bar avalanche,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- (West Palm Beach, FL – February 26, 2009) – As a precautionary measure in response to the ongoing investigations of Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) and its Texas facility, Rich Ice Cream Company, Inc. has expanded its voluntary recall to include Rich’s Candy Bar Avalanche because the product may contain peanuts which have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella.
Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.  For more information on Salmonella, please visit the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s website at www.cdc.gov.
Rich Ice Cream has received no complaints or reports of illnesses related to our product to date.  The recall was initiated after it was determined that the supplier of chocolate peanut clusters used in the product may have used peanuts from PCA’s Texas facility.  PCA is no longer a supplier for any peanut product or ingredient used at Rich Ice Cream Company.
Rich’s Candy Bar Avalanche is distributed in AL, CA, CO, CT, FL, GA, IL, IN, KS, KY, LA, MI, MO, NH, NJ, NY, NC, OH, OK, PA, PR, SC, TN, TX, VI, VA, Barbados and the Bahamas in bulk packages of 12, and sold to consumers in individual 10 fl. oz. ice cream cups, with UPC 75455-34100 on the individual package.  All lots are included in the recall, including all code dates beginning with a 7 or 8.
Because Rich’s Candy Bar Avalanche is typically consumed at the point of sale, it is unlikely that consumers will have the product on hand in their homes.  However, if for some reason consumers have the product at home, they are instructed to dispose of it.
For further information, contact Rich Ice Cream at 561-833-7585 M-F between 7:30 and 4:30 EST.",biological,ices and desserts,salmonella,ice cream

Recalls Norven Herring in Oil Because of Possible Health Risk","OLMA-XXI, Inc. of Brooklyn, NY, is recalling NORVEN herring in oil, Lot 530611, because it has the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.

The affected NORVEN herring in oil is packaged in plastic containers (tubs):
No illnesses have been reported to date.

   Lakeside Refrigerated Services Recalls Ground Beef Products  Due to Possible E. coli O103 Contamination
  
  FSIS Announcement
  
  
  
            WASHINGTON, April 25, 2022 – Lakeside Refrigerated Services, a Swedesboro, N.J. establishment, is recalling approximately 120,872 pounds of ground beef products that may be contaminated with E. coli O103, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.
The ground beef products were produced from February 1, 2022, through April 8, 2022. The complete list of products and product codes for the beef products that are subject to recall can be found here. Labels for the ground beef products can be found here.
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 46841” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations nationwide.              
The problem was discovered during routine FSIS testing of imported products. There have been no confirmed reports of illness or adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.
Many clinical laboratories do not test for non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) such as O103 because it is harder to identify than STEC O157:H7. People can become ill from STECs 2–8 days (average of 3–4 days) after consuming the organism.
Most people infected with STEC O103 develop diarrhea (often bloody) and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment; antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended. Most people recover within a week, but, rarely, some develop a more severe infection. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a type of kidney failure, is uncommon with STEC O103 infection. HUS can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old, older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.
FSIS is concerned that some products may be in consumers’ refrigerators or freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.
FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.
Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Lakeside Refrigerated Services at 800-493-9042 or customercare@lakesiderefrigerated.com.
Consumers with food safety questions can call the toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 888-MPHotline (888-674-6854) or live chat via Ask USDA from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday. Consumers can also browse food safety messages at Ask USDA or send a question via email to MPHotline@usda.gov.

3058,2017,12,16,us,Piller's Fine Foods Recalls Ready-To-Eat Salami and Speck Products  due to Possible Salmonella Adulteration,"WASHINGTON, Dec. 16, 2017 – Piller’s Fine Foods, a Waterloo, Canada establishment, is recalling approximately 1,076 pounds of ready-to-eat salami and speck products that may be adulterated with Salmonella, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The ready-to-eat speck prosciutto and salami items were produced on Sept. 22 and Oct. 12, 2017, respectively. The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF only)]

Vacuum-sealed random weight plastic packages containing “Black Kassel Piller’s Dry Aged D’Amour Salami” with Best Before date of May 12, 2018

Vacuum-sealed random weight plastic packages containing “Black Kassel Piller’s Dry Aged Speck Smoked Prosciutto” with Best Before date of May 12, 2018.
These items were produced in Canada and were shipped to distribution centers in California, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey and New York.

The problem was discovered when an FSIS sample of the ready-to-eat salami product was confirmed positive for Salmonella. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.

Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen. The only way to confirm that meat and poultry products are cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

A spokesman for the CFS said, ""When handling a relevant complaint, the CFS found that the above-mentioned products, for which no import permission of the DFEH had been obtained, were sold at an online shop. The CFS immediately instructed the vendor concerned to stop sale of the products concerned and traced their source and distribution. Upon follow-up investigation, it was found that the sole importer concerned had imported 900 cartons of the products. The CFS immediately instructed the importer concerned to stop sale of the products in question, remove them from shelves and initiate a recall. Enquiries about the recall can be made to the importer's hotline at 6728 6005 during office hours. Prosecution will be instituted should there be sufficient evidence.""

According to the Milk Regulation (Cap. 132AQ), any person who sells any milk or milk beverage imported into Hong Kong from a source of manufacture other than a source of manufacture which has been approved by the DFEH commits an offence. The maximum penalty is a fine of $10,000 and imprisonment for three months upon conviction.

The CFS will alert the trade to the incident and remind importers of milk products that they should comply with the requirements under the Milk Regulation. It will continue to follow up and take appropriate action to safeguard food safety and public health. Investigation is ongoing.

People who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to walnuts run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume this product.
Zoe’s Cookies are manufactured by Dough-to-Go and were sold to a local foodservice distributor and subsequently distributed to their customers in the San Francisco Bay Area.

990,2009,10,17,us,Wisconsin Firm Recalls Beef Tongues That Contain Prohibited Materials,"WASHINGTON, October 17, 2009 - Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation, a Milwaukee, Wisc., establishment is recalling approximately 5,522 pounds of beef tongues that may not have had the tonsils completely removed, which is not compliant with regulations that require the removal of tonsils from cattle of all ages, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.
                                  
 Tonsils are considered a specified risk material (SRM) and must be removed from cattle of all ages in accordance with FSIS regulations. SRMs are tissues that are known to contain the infective agent in cattle infected with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), as well as materials that are closely associated with these potentially infective tissues. Therefore, FSIS prohibits SRMs from use as human food to minimize potential human exposure to the BSE agent.

  FSIS Announcement
  
  
  
            WASHINGTON, July 12, 2022 – The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is issuing a public health alert due to concerns that the salad dressing component of ready-to-eat (RTE) Caesar salad with chicken may contain egg, a known allergen, which is not declared on the finished product label. FSIS is issuing this public health alert to ensure that consumers with an allergy to eggs are aware that these products should not be consumed. A recall was not requested because the products are no longer available for purchase.
The Caesar salads with chicken were produced on July 5, 2022. The following products are subject to the public health alert [view labels]:
9 oz. plastic clamshell containers of “TRADER JOE’S CAESAR SALAD WITH WHITE CHICKEN MEAT and Creamy Caesar Dressing” with best by dates of 07/11/22 and 07/12/22, and a lot code of GHNW 186-06.
The products bear establishment number “P-46987” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to Trader Joe’s locations in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.               
The problem was discovered when the producing establishment notified FSIS thatthey were informed by a store that the salad dressing packets in the Caesar salad product appeared incorrect. The dressing packets with the salad contain Sweet and Spicy Vinaigrette and not the Creamy Caesar Dressing. These dressing packets are unlabeled and contain egg, which is not declared on the finished product packaging.
There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an illness should contact a health care provider.
FSIS has verified the affected products are no longer available for sale but is concerned that some products may be in consumers’ refrigerators. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

Recalls Chicken Strip Products Due to Possible Foreign Matter Contamination","EDITOR’S NOTE:This release is being reissued as an expansion of the March 21, 2019 recall, which consisted of 69,093 pounds of frozen, ready-to-eat chicken strip products. The scope of this recall expansion now includes more information and an additional 11,760,424 pounds of product.


WASHINGTON, May 4, 2019 – Tyson Foods, Inc., a Rogers, Ark. establishment, is recalling approximately 11,829,517 million pounds of frozen, ready-to-eat chicken strip products that may be contaminated with extraneous materials, specifically pieces of metal, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The frozen, ready-to-eat chicken strip items were produced on various dates from Oct. 1, 2018 through March 8, 2019 and have “Use By Dates” of Oct. 1, 2019 through March 7, 2020. The chart contains a list of the products subject to recall.[View Labels (PDF only)]

The products subject to recall bear establishment number “P-7221” on the back of the product package. These items were shipped to retail and Department of Defense locations nationwide, for institutional use nationwide and to the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The problem was discovered when FSIS received two consumer complaints of extraneous material in the chicken strip products. FSIS is now aware of six complaints during this time frame involving similar pieces of metal with three alleging oral injury.

Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers’ freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

The meat and poultry breakfast products were produced on various dates from July 16, 2014 through Sept. 25, 2014, and then shipped to distributors, retail locations, and airlines nationwide. The following products are subject to recall:

“Swiss Cheese and Mushroom Omelet with Seasonal Tid-Bit Potatoes & Turkey Buffet Sausage Link” trays with the production codes “07/16/14 9”, “08/08/14 9” and “08/27/14 9”.

Case labels or packaging may bear the establishment number “EST. 4226” or “P-4226” inside the USDA mark of inspection.

The problem was discovered when an FSIS product sample confirmed positive for Listeria monocytogenes (Lm). The tested product was held, and the recalling firm tested raw materials from the product and found that the roasted red skin potatoes, which were provided by an independent supplier, tested positive for Lm. The firm is recalling all products that used the confirmed positive potatoes. FSIS and the company have received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of these products.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

Oskri Corporation of Lake Mills, Wisconsin is the manufacturer of Inspired Organics nut and seed butters. We are working closely with Oskri Corporation, the MDARD, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to understand the cause of the situation and ensure that all affected product has been pulled from commerce. No illnesses have been reported to date.
Lipari Foods began shipping the product on April 12, 2018.

The illness often begins suddenly. Even after having the illness, you can still become re-infected by norovirus. The main symptoms of norovirus illness are diarrhea, vomiting (children usually experience more vomiting than adults), nausea and stomach cramps. Other symptoms may include low-grade fever, headache, chills, muscle aches and fatigue (a general sense of tiredness). Most people feel better within one or two days, with symptoms resolving on their own, and experience no long-term health effects. As with any illness causing diarrhea or vomiting, people who are ill should drink plenty of liquids to replace lost body fluids and prevent dehydration. In severe cases, patients may need to be hospitalized and given fluids intravenously.

4107,2019,6,6,us,Advocare Issues Allergy Alert in Select Bottles of Muscle Strength and Nighttime Recovery Product Because of Undeclared Milk Allergen on The Label,"null AdvoCare International has commenced a voluntary recall of two lots of Muscle Strength and four lots of Nighttime Recovery dietary supplements because they may contain undeclared milk that can elicit an allergic reaction in individuals who are sensitive to milk and milk products. Individuals who are highly sensitive to milk protein who consumed caplets from these lots may experience symptoms common to a milk allergy including gastrointestinal issues or allergenic skin reactions. Even in those instances involving more intense reactions, any anticipated effects are expected to resolve quickly and typically do not require medical treatment. Product was distributed nationwide through AdvoCare and our Independent Distributors. Affected product includes 15,640 units of Muscle Strength, Product code: P3221 with lot numbers: 7063341, 7082161, and sold between November 15, 2017 - March 29, 2018 and 48,176 units of Nighttime Recovery, Product code: P3201 lot numbers: 7081841, 7063321, 7052411, 7090471, sold between December 15, 2017 - March 28, 2018. No reports of adverse events due to a milk allergen had been reported prior to the recall. As part of a routine formula review, a prospective manufacturer indicated the presence of milk in Ashwagandha, a raw ingredient common to both Muscle Strength and Nighttime Recovery. After AdvoCare was alerted to the possibility of trace amounts of milk in both products, we immediately conducted an investigation and engaged a third-party health hazard evaluation. The investigation concluded that Ashwagandha was extracted using milk. Therefore, trace amounts of milk can be detected in these specific lots. The risk of a mild or severe adverse reaction exists but is extremely low (i.e., less than 0.5% of the adult population). AdvoCare suspended sales of Nighttime Recovery and Muscle Strength while issuing the voluntary recall. Communications were sent to all Distributors and Customers who purchased the affected product through the AdvoCare website. Distributors were instructed to contact any customer to whom they sold the product in-person using the sample email communication. If you purchased any of the affected product, AdvoCare is urging consumers to call Customer Service at 1-800- 542-4800 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Mon - Fri for a full refund or exchange of the product.",allergens,herbs and spices,milk and products thereof,dried herb powder ashwagandha (withania somnifera)

2646,2017,2,9,us,Legendary Baking Issues Allergy Alert-Almonds and Egg in Salted Caramel Chocolate Almond Pie Allergens Declared but Listed Under “May Contain”,"Legendary Baking of Denver, CO, is recalling its 34 ounce packages of Private Selection Salted Caramel Chocolate Almond Pie because the almonds and eggs were listed under “may contains” instead of “contains”. People who have allergies to almonds and eggs run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume these products.
The recalled Private Selection Salted Caramel Chocolate Almond Pies were distributed in Kroger, Fry’s, and Smith’s retail stores in the following states: AL, AZ, GA, IL, IN, KY, MI, NM, OH, SC, TN, and WV.
The product comes in a 34 ounce, clear plastic package dome with a black plastic bottom base and is marked with lot # CH17025 on the side of the clear plastic dome.
No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem.
The recall was initiated after it was discovered by the manufacturing facility that the almond and egg-containing product was distributed in packaging that did not have the correct product ingredient statement and allergen declaration. Subsequent investigation indicates the problem was caused by a temporary error in the packaging processes.
Consumers who have purchased 34 ounce packages of Private Selection Salted Caramel Chocolate Almond Pie are urged to return them to the place of purchase for a full refund should they have allergen issues.

1249,2012,8,31,us,2012 - BI-LO Issues Voluntary Recall on Daniella Brand Mangoes Due to Possible Health Risk,"Contact: Consumer: 1-800-862-9293 Media: Amanda Lenar 864-672-2810 amanda.lenar@erwinpenland.com FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE August 31, 2112 - Today BI-LO announced an immediate voluntary recall on whole Daniella brand mangoes sold with a universal product code (UPC) of 0-00000-04051 in stores between  July 12 and Aug. 27, 2012.  The recalled mangoes, a product of Mexico, were sold as individual fruit and can be identified by the Daniella brand sticker.  The product is being recalled in the states of Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee due to a potential health risk from possible contamination with Salmonella Braenderup.
Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems.  Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.  In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
Out of an abundance of caution for customer safety and as a service to the general consuming public at large, the Daniella brand mangoes are being recalled in consultation with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The company has received no reports of illness associated with product consumption.
""We encourage consumers in possession of the recalled item to immediately discard the product or bring it back to their local BI-LO,” said Brian Wright, BI-LO’s senior director of communications.  “As part of the company’s Satisfaction Guarantee, customers who have purchased the product may visit their neighborhood store to request a full refund.”
Consumers are advised not to eat the mangoes and to either discard or return them to BI-LO for a refund.  To receive the refund, individuals must present proof of purchase through a receipt. Customers with questions about the recalled mangoes may contact BI-LO’s consumer relations department at 1-800-862-9293. Hours of operation are Monday-Friday from 8 a.m. – 6 p.m., and Saturday from 8 a.m. – 5 p.m. ET. Consumers who may have purchased mangoes without sticker information are urged to consult the store for sourcing information.
About BI-LO Headquartered in Mauldin, S.C., BI-LO operates 206 supermarkets in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee, employing approximately 16,995 people. Founded in 1961, the company provides shoppers substantial savings without sacrificing quality or freshness through its BI-LO BONUSCARD® and other exclusive programs.  A committed corporate citizen, BI-LO has raised more than $63 million through its BI-LO Charities efforts to organizations across the company’s footprint since 1984.  For more information, visit www.bi-lo.com.",biological,fruits and vegetables,salmonella,mango

Check to see if you have the recalled products in your home or establishment. Recalled products should be thrown out or returned to the location where they were purchased. People with norovirus illness usually develop symptoms of gastroenteritis within 24 to 48 hours, but symptoms can start as early as 12 hours after exposure. The illness often begins suddenly. Even after having the illness, you can still become re-infected by norovirus. The main symptoms of norovirus illness are diarrhea, vomiting (children usually experience more vomiting than adults), nausea and stomach cramps. Other symptoms may include low-grade fever, headache, chills, muscle aches and fatigue (a general sense of tiredness). Most people feel better within one or two days, with symptoms resolving on their own, and experience no long-term health effects. As with any illness causing diarrhea or vomiting, people who are ill should drink plenty of liquids to replace lost body fluids and prevent dehydration. In severe cases, patients may need to be hospitalized and given fluids intravenously.

1319,2013,1,24,us,Texas Firm Recalls Ready-To-Eat Pork Products Due to Possible Salmonella Contamination,"WASHINGTON, January 24, 2013 - Stallings Head Cheese Co., Inc., a Houston, Texas establishment, is recalling 4,700 pounds of hog head cheese that may be contaminated with Salmonella, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.


Recommendations for Preventing Salmonellosis:

Wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw meat and poultry. Also wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot soapy water. Clean up spills right away.

Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry and egg products and cooked foods.

Cook raw meat and poultry to safe internal temperatures before eating. The safe internal temperature for meat such as ground beef and pork is 160° F, and 165° F for poultry, as determined with a food thermometer.

Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase (one hour if temperatures exceed 90° F). Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.

The following products are subject to recall: [Labels]

10-oz. packages of ""Richard's Hog Head Cheese"" bearing establishment number ""EST. 2257"" inside the USDA mark of inspection and sell by dates ""Use by 2 1 2013"" or ""Use by 3 20 2013""on each package.
The products subject to recall were produced on November 1, 2012, and December 19, 2012. The products were shipped to a distribution center for retail distribution in Louisiana and Southeastern Texas. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on FSIS' website at: www.fsis.usda.gov/FSIS_Recalls/Open_Federal_Cases/index.asp.

Hog head cheese products produced by EST. 2257 have been linked to a recent Salmonella Uganda cluster involving six case-patients from Louisiana. Working in conjunction with the Louisiana Office of Public Health, FSIS was able to link illnesses to the RTE pork products produced at this establishment based on epidemiologic and traceback investigations. Illness onset dates among the case-patients ranged from October 16, 2012 to November 10, 2012. Four case-patients confirmed eating the brand under recall. Leftover RTE product from consumers was not available for testing. However, retail samples of like product from different production dates underwent testing last week, and four of nine samples tested positive for Salmonella. It is not known at this time if these samples are positive for the outbreak strain, but any finding of such will be made public by FSIS once it becomes available. FSIS is continuing to work with public health partners on the investigation.

Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

2450,2016,9,27,us,caviness beef packers recalls beef products due to possible e. coli o103 contamination,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 27, 2016 – Caviness Beef Packers, a Hereford, Texas establishment, is recalling approximately 2,100 pounds of boneless beef trim products that may be contaminated withE. coli O103, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. 

The 2,100-lb. Combo Bin of “boneless beef trim 84L” products were produced on September 14, 2016 and further processed into ground beef products by another establishment. The recalling establishment has control of all but 320 pounds of ground beef products.

10 lb. chub - 73% Regular Ground Beef products with a “Use By” or “Freeze By” date of October 10, 2016 and bear UPC number 52846-48935.

2-3 lb. tray pack of - 73% Regular Ground Beef products with a “Sell By” date of September 28, 2016 and bear UPC number 2-01656-00000.

1.5 lb. tray pack of - 73% Regular Ground Beef products with a “Sell By” date of September 28, 2016 and bear UPC number 2-01654-00000.
The products subject to this recall were further processed by a firm other than Caviness Beef Packers, “EST. 675” and may not bear the establishment number ""EST. 675"", on products available for direct consumer purchase. These products were shipped to retail locations in Texas.

The problem was discovered when FSIS was notified of a USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) sample that tested positive for E. coli 0103. Because the company works with the AMS Commodity Program, AMS did routine microbiological testing. This shipment of beef was never intended for the National School Lunch Program (NLSP) and no sales were made to the NLSP. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.

Many clinical laboratories do not test for non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), such as STEC O103 because it is harder to identify than STEC O157. People can become ill from STECs 2–8 days (average of 3–4 days) after consuming the organism. Most people infected with STEC O103 develop diarrhea (often bloody), and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment; antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended.

Most people recover within a week, but, rarely, some develop a more severe infection. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is uncommon with O103 infection. HUS can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old, older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

6247,2022,3,23,us,"Consumer Alert: Undeclared Sulfites in ""Licorice Flavor Olive""","“When a Government Agency Partner announces a company’s recall, market withdrawal, or safety alert, the FDA posts the Government Agency Partner’s announcement as a public service. FDA does not endorse either the product or the company.” New York State Agriculture Commissioner Richard A. Ball today alerted consumers that A&C Best Food Trading Inc., located at 36-08 Review Ave in Long Island City, New York 11101, is recalling “Licorice Flavor Olive” due to the presence of undeclared sulfites. People who have severe sensitivity to sulfites may run the risk of serious or life-threatening reactions if they consume this product. To date, no illnesses have been reported to this Department in connection with this product. The recalled “Licorice Flavor Olive” is packaged in clear plastic jar which weights approximately one pound. The product is coded “2021/10/15” stamped on the bottom of the jar and has a UPC code of “588552-331090”. The product was distributed nationally. Routine sampling by New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets food inspectors and subsequent analysis of the product by New York State Food Laboratory personnel revealed the product contained high levels of sulfites which were not declared on the label. The consumption of 10 milligrams of sulfites per serving has been reported to elicit severe reactions, including anaphylactic shock, in some asthmatics and sensitive individuals. Consumers who are sensitive to sulfites and have purchased “Licorice Flavor Olive” should not consume it. Consumers with questions about the recalled product may contact Allen Lin, Manager at (917) 418-1115 or may email the distributor at hengwen315701@gmail.com.

Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
Tropical Fruit Supreme, Pineapple Nut Delight, and Pistachio Crème were distributed in Texas, Arkansas, and Oklahoma to foodservice distributors and retail supermarkets.
Product is packaged in plastic containers with the following information on the label.
No illnesses have been reported to date.
The recall is due to a recall of an ingredient used in manufacturing these products. Valley Milk Products reported that certain lots of dry milk they manufactured have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella. While Pistachio Crème does not contain the ingredient, it is made on the same production line as Tropical Fruit Supreme and Pineapple Nut Delight therefore we are recalling it as well.
Consumers who have purchased the above products are urged not to consume the product and to return it to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact the company at 1.800.856.3131, M-F 8am-4pm CST.

6394,2022,5,25,us,Supplier J.M. Smucker Co.’s Jif Recall Prompts Fresh Del Monte to Voluntarily Recall Select Ready-To-Eat Products Due to Potential Salmonella Contamination,"(Miami, FL – May 24, 2022) - J.M. Smucker Co.’s voluntary recall of select Jif products in the United States has prompted Fresh Del Monte to voluntarily recall fresh-cut fruit and vegetable products containing ready-to-eat Jif peanut butter dip due to the potential presence of Salmonella contamination. In response and out of an abundance of caution, Fresh Del Monte is recalling the following products, which were sold to retailers nationwide: Del Monte Apples with Peanut Butter (5 ounce) Peanut Butter Snack Pack (4.25 ounce), Apples and Peanut Butter (6 ounce, and 5.5 ounce), and Sandwich with Peanut Butter Cup. This recall does not affect any other Fresh Del Monte portfolio items, which are completely safe, and not implicated as the source of this recall. The scope of this Fresh Del Monte recall is very limited as it relates to the company’s portfolio and only affects a few products containing J.M. Smuckers’ Jif peanut butter. Salmonella is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis, and arthritis. Consumers can review the official J.M Smucker Co. FDA press release here. Products subject to the voluntary recall of fresh-cut fruits and vegetables are packaged in clear plastic containers with a tamper-evident seal and identified with a Del Monte “Best If Used By” (DM BIUB) date on, or before, May 30, 2022. Consumers can identify the recalled product using the information in the table at the end of this release. Consumers who still have any of these products in their refrigerators are urged not to consume the product and discard it immediately. Retailers have been advised to check store shelves and warehouse inventories to confirm that no recalled product is available for purchase by consumers. Any Jif peanut butter snack packs that were packed in fruit snack trays from September 1, 2021, through May 20, 2022, that may be still on hand should be disposed of as well. Consumers with questions may contact the company’s customer service desk at 305-520-8668 or 1-800-659-6500, Monday thru Friday from 8:30 am to 5:30 pm Eastern Time, email consumers@freshdelmonte.com, or visit its website at https://delmontefresh.com/about-us/contact-us.

Immature animals are more sensitive to aflatoxins.  Acute aflatoxicosis may result in generalized hemorrhage, bloody diarrhea and death in 1-3 days.  In addition, aflatoxin toxicity can cause reduced feed intake, reduced weight gain, liver damage, jaundice, and eventually death.   No adverse health effects to animals have been reported to date. Nonetheless, Cargill is taking this voluntary step out of an abundance of caution. The affected products were manufactured at Cargill’s Cleveland, North Carolina, facility. Cargill first learned of the issue when it received a notification from the North Carolina Department of Agriculture of test results showing that a single lot of a specific Southern States product contained elevated levels of aflatoxin. Cargill has identified and corrected the root cause. The following affected products were recalled from retail outlets and distributors in the Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia markets and removed from retail shelves throughout February, March, and April 2019.  To view the label for each product, please click on the link in the table below that corresponds to that product. Consumers and other end users who have any of the affected lots in their possession should return remaining product to their local dealer or retailer for a replacement or full refund. For more information, call 800-822-1012 (Monday through Friday between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time). At Cargill, the safety of our products and the well-being of the animals we feed is our top priority. This recall is being conducted with the knowledge of and in cooperation with the United States Food and Drug Administration.",chemical,pet feed,Aflatoxin,pet feed
1605,2014,7,18,us,North Carolina Firm Recalls Grilled Chicken Product Due to Misbranding and Undeclared Allergen,"WASHINGTON, July 18, 2014–B. Roberts Foods, a Charlotte, N.C., establishment, is recalling approximately 202 pounds of individual serving grilled chicken entrées due to misbranding and an undeclared allergen, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. The product contains milk, a known allergen, which is not declared on the product label.

The following product is subject to recall:

10 oz. (248 g) Refrigerated Packages of ""Harris Teeter, Fresh Foods Market, Deli-Bakery, All Natural Grilled Chicken Strips (minimally processed, no artificial ingredients)""
The top label on the packaging incorrectly reads ""All Natural Grilled Chicken Strips (minimally processed, no artificial ingredients), Net Wt 10 oz. (248g)"" and the bottom label incorrectly reads ""Grilled Chicken Breast with Lemon Spaghettini"" when both labels should read ""Grilled Chicken Breast with Sundried Tomato Pasta."" The product was produced on July 10, 2014, and bears the establishment number ""Est. 19198"" inside the USDA mark of inspection with package code ""50223"" and ""Sell By"" date of ""07/27/14"".

The product was distributed to retail stores in Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and Washington, D.C.

The problem was discovered by a grocery store employee who saw that the product was incorrectly labeled. The grocery store reported the error to B. Roberts Foods, which confirmed the ""Grilled Chicken Breast with Sundried Tomato Pasta"" entrées were incorrectly labeled due to an employee error. In addition to the incorrect labels, the recalled product is made with milk, which is a known allergen and must be noted on the label.

FSIS and the company have received no reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about a reaction should contact a healthcare provider.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to ensure that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

Consumers and media with questions about the recall should contact Antonio Gilges at (704) 944-5311 or via email at agilges@brobertsfoods.com.

One sample from LOT 30 was found to be positive for Salmonella Give.While we are not aware of any further positive samples, Mahina Mele Farms feels it is in the best interest of public health to voluntarily recall ALL lots currently on the market, until the source of the contamination can be identified.
Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
Mahina Mele Farms is working with retailers to pull products from store shelves. To date no illnesses have been reported in connection with these products.
Mahina Mele Farms, LLC produces macadamia nuts under the name Izzie Macs! in plastic bags and macadamia nut butter under the name Baby Bruddah's Mac Nut Buttah in plastic tubs. They were distributed from Oct 21, 2015 - Jan 20, 2016 and involve all products
In the interest of public health and safety, we are recalling all products. We are working closely with the FDA to find the source of this contamination.
Customers who have purchased the above products should not consume them and should return them to the store where they were purchased for a full refund or replacement. Mahina Mele Farms, LLC will reimburse the wholesaler for any returned product.

JULY 15, 2021 RECALL: BrightFarms today initiated a voluntary recall of packaged salad greens produced in its Rochelle, Illinois (Ogle County) greenhouse farm sold in Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa and Indiana because it has the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella. The affected BrightFarms-branded products were sold by the following retailers: Sullivan's Foods, Caputo's, Jewel-Osco Additional retailers may be affected.

BrightFarms is taking this action out of an abundance of caution after being notified of illnesses among eleven consumers, some of whom purchased or consumed the above products during the month of June. Affected retailers have been instructed to remove all affected products from store shelves. BrightFarms is committed to providing wholesome products, and the health and safety of consumers is the company's number one priority. In addition to today's voluntary recall, the company has already begun taking steps to enhance their already rigorous food safety protocols, including testing all products produced in its Rochelle facility for exposure to Salmonella prior to distribution. Consumers who have purchased the affected products should discard them or return them to their place of purchase for a full refund.

2552,2016,12,12,us,"Valley Milk Products, Strasburg, Virginia Recalls Limited Amount of Milk and Buttermilk Powder Because of Possible Health Risks","Valley Milk Products is announcing a recall of 50-pound bags of nonfat high heat milk powder and sweet cream buttermilk powder that were produced from December 10, 2015 to July 5, 2016 due to potential Salmonella contamination, which was identified at the manufacturing facility but not in tested finished product.
Salmonella is a bacteria that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream such as septicemia, arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.

The products included in the recall can be identified by the following lot numbers which can be found in the lower right front of each bag.

These products are not sold directly to consumers, but are used as ingredients in a number of foods uch as bakery products and distributed by brokers. None of the recalled finished product tested positive for Salmonella but environmental sampling performed by the FDA was positive for Salmonella. Valley Milk is currently investigating the cause for the positive environmental samples.

Below are some pertinent facts and references to aid food manufacturers in determining the disposition of their affected products.

For companies that used the Valley Milk recalled milk powder or buttermilk powder in a consumer ready-to-eat product and there is no FDA-recognized kill step or inactivation step in their processing system, their supplier should be immediately notified with such details as the product which contained the recalled Valley Milk powder products, the amounts of the products, whether these products are in storage or have already been distributed, where the distributed products are and records or other evidence that the recalled Valley Milk powder was used. Their supplier will in-turn notify Valley Milk.

The FDA is available to help companies review their specific processes and determine if additional action is warranted.

All customers that have received these products have been notified by Valley Milk and instructed to return the suspect powder or document the destruction of the powder, after contacting Valley Milk for specific instructions. In case someone identifies Valley Milk powders with the above lot numbers in their dry storage warehouse and has not been ontacted by a Valley Milk representative, please contact Michael Curtis at 301-512-5053 or mcurtis@mdvamilk.com immediately for instructions.

At Valley Milk Products, we are dedicated to producing dairy products that meet the highest quality and safety standards required by our customers as well as complying with all government food safety requirements. Valley Milk Products has a long history of producing these products from our own dairy farmers in the historic Shenandoah Valley of Virginia.

On October 22, 2018, FSIS was notified of a cluster of listeriosis illnesses that were closely related. Working in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state public health partners, FSIS determined that there is a link between the Listeria monocytogenes illnesses and ready-to-eat pork products produced by Long Phung Foods. The epidemiologic investigation identified a total of four listeriosis confirmed illnesses between July 1, 2017 and October 24, 2018. On November 19, 2018, whole genome sequencing of investigative samples collected from Long Phung Foods Establishment M13561 showed that the samples were closely related genetically to Listeria monocytogenes from ill people. FSIS is continuing to work with federal and state public health partners to determine if there are additional illnesses linked to these products and will provide updated information should it become available.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers’ freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

3813,2019,1,7,us,Hy-Vee Voluntarily Recalls Cheesecakes Made with Diamond Crystal Mix,"Hy-Vee, Inc., based in West Des Moines, Iowa, is voluntarily recalling its cheesecakes made with Diamond Crystal Brands cheesecake mix due to the potential that they may be contaminated with Salmonella. The potential for contamination was brought to Hy-Vee’s attention today after receiving a letter from the supplier. The voluntary recall includes 32 varieties of cheesecakes in both 8-ounce and 32-ounce packages with best if used by dates of Dec. 6, 2018, through Jan. 11, 2019. No illnesses have been reported to date.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Salmonella is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
The mixture was distributed to 117 of Hy-Vee’s 249 grocery stores across its eight-state region of Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin. The product comes in a plastic container with a plastic lid. The expiration date range is between Dec. 6, 2018, and Jan. 11, 2019. The expiration date can be found on the label. 
Out of an abundance of caution, Hy-Vee removed the product from the shelves of its stores as soon as it was notified about the situation.
It is important to note that all other Hy-Vee cheesecakes of the same variety but with a different UPC Code are NOT impacted by this voluntary recall.
Customers who purchased any of these products should dispose of them or return them to their local Hy-Vee store for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact Hy-Vee Customer Care representatives 24 hours a day, seven days a week at 1-800-772-4098.

The ground beef items were produced and packaged on June 21, 2018. The following products are subject to recall: (Products List)[View Labels(PDF only)]  

The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 86R” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations nationwide.

On Aug. 16, 2018, FSIS was notified of an investigation of E. coli O26 illnesses. FSIS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and state public health and agriculture partners determined that raw ground beef was the probable source of the reported illnesses. The epidemiological investigation identified 17 illnesses and one death with illness onset dates ranging from July 5 to July 25, 2018.                

The Cargill Meat Solutions’ ground beef products were identified following further investigation related to Recall 072-2018, conducted on Aug. 30, 2018, where ground beef products were recalled in connection with the E. coli O26 outbreak. FSIS’ traceback information indicated that case-patients consumed ground beef products purchased at various retail stores that were supplied by Cargill Meat Solutions.

E. coli O26, like the more common E. coli O157:H7, is a serovar of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC). People can become ill from STECs 2–8 days (average of 3–4 days) after exposure to the organism.

Most people infected with STEC O26 develop diarrhea (often bloody) and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment; antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended. Most people recover within a week, but rarely, some develop a more severe infection. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a type of kidney failure, is common with STEC O26 infection. HUS can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old, older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately

FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers’ freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.    

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160°F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ. Consumers should take proper precautions when handling raw meat products. Proper hand washing after handling raw meat, poultry and eggs can greatly reduce the risk of bacterial cross-contamination to other foods and kitchen surfaces. It is important to prevent cross-contamination by washing counter tops and sinks with hot, soapy water.

Media with questions regarding the recall can contact Michael Martin, Cargill Meat Solutions communications director, at (316) 291-2126 or at michael_martin@cargill.com. Consumers with questions regarding the recall can call 1-844-419-1574.

2076,2016,2,13,us,garden of life expands voluntary recall to include additional lots of raw meal products due to possible salmonella contamination,"Garden of Life LLC is expanding its January 29th voluntary recall to include additional lots of its Raw Meal Organic Shake & Meal Chocolate, Original, Vanilla and Vanilla Chai products because an ingredient used in certain lots of the product has the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella Virchow. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. If you have symptoms or concerns, please talk to your doctor.
Garden of Life has requested that retailers remove the lots of Raw Meal from sale and that consumers check the lot number on their Raw Meal product and return any products involved in this recall to their point of purchase for a full refund.
After extensive testing of the product and its ingredients, and working in collaboration with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the manufacturer, suppliers and other third-party experts, the Company has now identified the likely source of Salmonella contamination to be Organic Moringa Leaf powder from a supplier used only in Raw Meal. Because other Garden of Life products containing Moringa use different suppliers, only Raw Meal is exposed.
Following is the list of lots affected added to this recall. Consumers can find the lot codes prominently stamped on the underside of the plastic container.
February 12, 2016 Recall Lots
No other Garden of Life products are affected by this recall.
To prevent a recurrence of this issue, Garden of Life will remove Organic Moringa powder from Raw Meal and expects new Raw Meal products to be available in stores and through online retailers within the next few weeks.
“The health of our consumers matters more than anything to every Garden of Life employee,” said Brian Ray, Garden of Life’s President. “We are using this as an opportunity to review our entire sourcing, manufacturing and distribution system with an eye to making a safe system even better. We will always work to be the industry leader in food safety; we expect nothing less and know you do as well. You can expect to hear more from us on this topic going forward. On behalf of all of us, I apologize to everyone affected by this situation.”
ABOUT RAW MEAL: Raw Meal is sold at better health food stores, natural grocers and online. Consumers who have a Raw Meal product affected by this recall should stop consuming the product and if they wish to return it, they should return the unused portion of the product to the place of purchase for a full refund. Questions may be directed Monday-Friday between the hours of 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM EST to GOL Retail Support at the e mail and phone number below.

Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. For more information on Salmonella, please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Website at http://www.cdc.gov.
The new items are:
A complete list of the products now affected can be found on the company’s website (www.perrysicecream.com)

The company has not received any consumer illness complaints about these products.

1277,2012,10,10,us,2012 - Nina International Recalls Ground Hot Pepper Because Of Possible Health Risk,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - October 10, 2012 - Out of the utmost caution and care for our customers, Nina International of Hyattsville, MD is initiating a voluntary recall of its brand of Ground Hot Pepper, 5oz, because it has the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
Ground Hot Pepper was distributed in MD, Washington, DC and VA and reached consumers through African and ethnic retail food stores. The product is in a 5oz, clear plastic container, and inscribed with “Nina International, The Best Brand” and “Ground Hot Pepper, Chillies, All Natural.” It has a yellow seal with a red “Nina” inscription and the barcode is 745851004004.
Nina International is issuing this voluntary recall to minimize the risk to the public health. No related illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem.
The recall was as the result of a routine testing program which revealed that the finished products contained the bacteria. The company has ceased the distribution of the product as we continue to identify the source of the problem.
This recall is being made with the knowledge of the Food and Drug Administration.
Consumers who have purchased Nina International Ground Hot Pepper are urged to return it to the place of purchase for a full refund.
Thank you for your understanding and cooperation in this regard. Please feel free to contact us should you require additional information or assistance.

Recalls Gluten-Free Turkey Meatball Products Due to Misbranding","WASHINGTON, Oct. 30, 2015 – Joseph Epstein Food Enterprises, Inc., an East Rutherford, N.J. establishment, is recalling approximately 190 pounds of turkey meatball products due to misbranding, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. The label declares the product as “gluten-free,” a false negative claim.

The Mama Mancini’s gluten-free turkey meatball items were produced on Oct. 19, 2015. The following products are subject to recall:[View Labels]

22-oz. cartons of “Mama Mancini’s Slow Cooked Italian Style Sauce and Turkey Meatballs – Gluten Free.”
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “P-21734” inside the USDA mark of inspection, product code 4740 and expiration date “Use by 12/10/15.” These items were shipped to retail locations in New Jersey.

The problem was discovered during the establishment’s third party laboratory testing; the product was found to contain an excess of the maximum allowable 20 ppm of gluten. The establishment notified FSIS of the problem.

There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

1970,2015,11,1,us,"all american meats, inc. recalls ground beef products due to possible e. coli o157:h7 contamination","WASHINGTON, Nov. 01, 2015 – All American Meats, Inc., an Omaha, Neb. establishment, is recalling approximately 167,427 pounds of ground beef products that may be adulterated with E. coli O157:H7, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The ground beef items were produced on Oct. 16, 2015. The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF Only)]

80-lb. (approximate weight) boxes of “Ground Beef 80% Lean 20% Fat (Fine Grind)” with Sell By Date 11-03-2015 and case code 62100.

80-lb. (approximate weight) boxes of “Ground Beef Chuck 81% Lean 19% Fat (Fine Grind)” with Sell By Date 11-03-2015 and case code 63100.
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 20420” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations nationwide.

The problem was discovered on Oct. 30, 2015, when a positive result for E. coli O157:H7 from FSIS’ in-commerce surveillance program testing was traced back to the establishment. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.

E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2–8 days (3–4 days, on average) after exposure to the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

Consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Mr. Shawn Buchanan at (402) 734-6901. Media with questions regarding the recall can contact Mr. Brian Brislen at (402) 397-7300.

Wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw meat and poultry. Wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot, soapy water. Immediately clean spills.

Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry and egg products and cooked foods.

Color is NOT a reliable indicator that meat has been cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria.

The only way to be sure the meat or poultry is cooked to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use a thermometer to measure the internal temperature.

5643,2021,6,28,hk,Prepackaged dried mushroom and date samples in breach of food labelling regulation,"Prepackaged dried mushroom and date samples in breach of food labelling regulation The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department announced today (June 28) that a prepackaged dried mushroom sample and a prepackaged date sample were found to contain sulphur dioxide, a preservative which is allowed to be used in food, but its functional class and name were not declared on the product's food label, in breach of the food labelling regulations. Follow-up is in progress. Product details are as follows: Product name: (Not available in English) Place of origin: Japan Retailer: (Not available in English) Net weight: 0.5 catty per pack Best-before date: December 31, 2022 Product name: (Not available in English) Place of origin: China Retailer: Premier Food Ltd Net weight: 450 grams per pack Best-before date: December 30, 2022 ""The CFS collected the above-mentioned samples from two retail outlets for testing respectively under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The test results showed that the dried mushroom sample and the date sample contained sulphur dioxide at levels of 31 parts per million (ppm) and 65 ppm, respectively. Although the levels are within the legal limits, the functional class and name of the additive were not declared on the food labels,"" a CFS spokesman said. ""The CFS has informed the vendors concerned of the irregularities. According to the CFS's instructions, the retailers concerned have initiated a recall on the affected batches of the products. Members of the public may call their hotlines at 3188 3141 (for dried mushroom)/2291 6216 (for date) during office hours for enquiries about the recall of the products concerned. Prosecution will be instituted should there be sufficient evidence,"" the spokesman added. Sulphur dioxide is a commonly used preservative in a variety of foods including dried vegetables, dried fruits, pickled vegetables and salted fish products. Sulphur dioxide is water soluble, and most of it can be removed through washing and cooking. However, susceptible individuals who are allergic to this preservative may experience breathing difficulties, headaches and nausea after consumption. The spokesman reminded the food trade that the use of preservatives in food must comply with the Preservatives in Food Regulation (Cap. 132BD). Furthermore, the Food and Drugs (Composition and Labelling) Regulations (Cap. 132W) require that prepackaged food shall be legibly marked or labelled with a list of ingredients. The regulations also state that for all prepackaged food for sale in Hong Kong containing sulphite in a concentration of 10 ppm or more, the functional class of the sulphite and its name shall be specified in the list of ingredients. Offenders are liable to a maximum fine of $50,000 and six months' imprisonment upon conviction. The CFS will alert the trade, continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action.

Recalls Ready-To-Eat Poultry Products Due to Possible Listeria Contamination","WASHINGTON, Sept. 28, 2019 – Tip Top Poultry, Inc, a Rockmart, Ga., establishment, is recalling an undetermined amount of ready-to-eat (RTE) poultry products that may be adulterated with Listeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The frozen cooked, diced or shredded, RTE chicken products were produced between January 21, 2019 and September 24, 2019. The products subject to recall can be found in this spreadsheet. [View labels (PDF only)].

The products subject to recall bear establishment number “Est. P-17453” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to institutions nationwide in the United States and Canada (see the recalled products distributed in Canada).

The problem was discovered when the firm notified FSIS that multiple samples of product produced by Tip Top Poultry, Inc. confirmed positive for the presence of Listeria monocytogenes after being tested in Canada. The firm decided to recall all cooked, diced or shredded, RTE chicken products produced from January 21, 2019 through September 24, 2019 with product codes ranging from 10000 to 19999 and 70000 to 79999. Tip Top expanded the dates and the scope of the recall out of an abundance of caution.

There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be in institutional freezers. Institutions that have purchased these products are urged not to serve them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, a retail distribution list(s), if applicable, will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. No illnesses have been reported to date for these products. The company is issuing this recall out of an abundance of caution. The products have been distributed nationwide and to United Arab Emirates.

2833,2017,6,30,uk,Alpro recalls its Alpro Growing Up Drink (1-3+yrs 1 litre UHT pack) because of insufficient sterilisation,"Alpro is recalling its Alpro Growing Up Drink (1-3+ yrs 1 litre UHT pack) because of insufficient sterilisation. The implicated product has been sold only in Sainsbury’s stores.
Product: Alpro Growing Up Drink (1-3+yrs 1 litre UHT pack) Pack size: 1 Litre Best before:  05 March 2018 Batch codes starting with:  AB2310 XX:XX No other Alpro products are known to be affected.
The sterility of the batches listed has been compromised.  As a result the microbiological safety of these batches has also been compromised and this poses a risk to health, if the affected product is consumed. The affected batches may have developed an unpleasant texture, taste and smell.  
If you have purchased any of the above product do not drink it. Instead, return it to the store from where it was purchased for a full refund.
Alpro is recalling the above product. Point of sale notices will be displayed in all Sainsbury’s stores that have sold this product. These notices explain to customers why the product is being recalled and also tell them what to do if they have purchased the product. 
If there is a problem with a food product that means it should not be sold, then it might be 'withdrawn' (taken off the shelves) or 'recalled' (when customers are asked to return the product).

Recalled product Brand Product Size UPC Codes President's Choice Sensitive to lactose milk-based powdered infant formula 638 g 0 60383 12994 1 EXP 2020 NO 05 What you should do If you think you or a family member became sick from consuming a recalled product, call your doctor. Check to see if you have the recalled product in your home. Recalled products should be thrown out or returned to the store where they were purchased. Food contaminated with Cronobacter may not look or smell spoiled but can still cause illness. Although Cronobacter is not commonly linked to human illness, in rare cases it can cause serious or fatal infections. Cronobacter can cause rare bloodstream and central nervous system infections and has been associated with severe intestinal infection (necrotizing enterocolitis) and blood poisoning (sepsis), especially in newborns.

Affected Gourmondo Co. “Asparagus & Feta Sandwiches” were distributed in Washington to Metropolitan Market stores on 6/1 & 6/3. UPC Code: 859266007984. This product has the Gourmondo label and wrapped in cellophane. No illnesses have been reported to date regarding this issue. During a routine inspection, WSDA discovered that a printing error on the stickers for the “Asparagus and Feta Sandwich” did not contain the sub ingredients for “mayonnaise”, one of which being whole eggs. Eggs were also omitted in the list of allergens on the mislabeled stickers. Only 21 of these sandwiches were affected by this error, however, in our over-arching belief in safety and transparency, we are reporting this issue and recalling any product that may remain in inventory. As of the date of this writing, all affected products should show a “best buy” date of, or prior to, today and should already be slated for disposal. Customers with an egg allergy or sensitivity who have purchased the affected product are urged not to consume the product and dispose of it or return it to their place of purchase for a full refund. This recall is being made with the knowledge of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Should you require any further information regarding this recall. Please feel free to contact Gourmondo Co. directly at 206-587-0190 or by email at gourmondo@gourmondoco.com. Again, a very small sampling of our product was affected by this printing error.

  Nick’s Famous Bar-B-Q Recalls Ready-To-Eat Pork Products  Due to Possible Listeria Contamination
  




          I-65 BBQ, Inc.
    

  FSIS Announcement
  
  
  
            WASHINGTON, Oct. 8, 2021 – Nick’s Famous Bar-B-Q, a Nashville, Tenn., establishment, is recalling approximately 3,140 pounds of ready-to-eat (RTE) smoked pork barbecue products that may be adulterated with Listeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The frozen RTE hickory smoked pork barbecue products were produced on September 7, 2021 and September 8, 2021 and packaged on September 8, 2021. The following products are subject to recall [view the label here]:

20-lb. boxes of “Nick’s FAMOUS Hickory Smoked Pork Bar-B-Q” with a case code of 23452 and a use by date of 09/2022.
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 17863” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were distributed to institutions, including school locations in North Carolina. While the product was distributed to schools, it resulted from a commercial sale and was not part of food provided by the USDA for the National School Lunch Program.     

The problem was discovered by FSIS during an assessment of the establishment’s production records.

There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be in institutions’ freezers. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Patrick Lewis, co-owner of Nick's Famous Bar-B-Q, at patrick.lewis@nicksfamousbarbq.com or Rich Dupont, co-owner of Nick's Famous Bar-B-Q at rich.dupont@nicksfamousbarbq.com. 

Consumers with food safety questions can call the toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854) or live chat via Ask USDA from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday. Consumers can also browse food safety messages at Ask USDA or send a question via email to MPHotline@usda.gov. For consumers that need to report a problem with a meat, poultry, or egg product, the online Electronic Consumer Complaint Monitoring System can be accessed 24 hours a day at https://foodcomplaint.fsis.usda.gov/eCCF/.

The Beef Trimmings products were produced on August 14, 2014 and August 20, 2014. The following products are subject to recall:

Combo bins containing “Beef Trimmings, BNLS, 90 L”

Combo bins containing “Beef Trimmings, BNLS, 84 L”
The products subject to recall bear the establishment number “EST. 675” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These products were sent to establishments for further processing and will likely not bear the establishment number ""EST. 675"" on products available for direct consumer purchase.

While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

The only way to confirm that beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

The Trader Joe’s Broccoli Slaw & Kale Salad with White Chicken Meat product that is affected by this recall was produced April 26 through May 1, 2016, and has “USE BY” labels on the plastic packaging containing dates 05/02 through 05/07.

The problem was discovered on May 3, 2016, when the company’s vendor of sunflower seeds notified the company that the product might have been contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes.

Consumption of food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

5772,2021,8,13,us,Wet Noses Natural Dog Treat Company® Voluntarily Recalls Simply Nourish Brand Frozen Dog Food Due to Elevated Levels of Vitamin D,"August 13, 2021, Wet Noses Natural Dog Treat Company of Monroe, Washington is recalling approximately 51,000 packages of Simply Nourish frozen dog food, due to it containing elevated levels of Vitamin D. Consumers should stop feeding the products listed below to their dogs. Dogs ingesting elevated levels of Vitamin D may exhibit symptoms such as vomiting, loss of appetite, increased thirst, increased urination, excessive drooling, and weight loss. Vitamin D when consumed at very high levels or over a long period of time can lead to serious health issues in dogs including renal dysfunction. Consumers who have dogs that have consumed any of the products listed below and are exhibiting these symptoms, should contact their veterinarian. Affected Simply Nourish frozen food products were distributed at select PetSmart stores nationwide. Products are packaged in 2lb and 4.5lb packages across specific date ranges. A full list of affected products is below: No illnesses have been reported to date. No other products have been affected. The recall was initiated after a routine nutrition test confirmed elevated Vitamin D levels on certain Simply Nourish frozen food products. Subsequent investigation indicates the problem arose as a result of the vitamin mix dosage being significantly reduced by the vitamin mix manufacturer, and this change was not detected or properly communicated. As a result, the dosage was not reduced. We care deeply about our customers and their pets, and have put corrective actions into place to ensure this issue does not reoccur. This recall is being made with the knowledge of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Consumers who have purchased Simply Nourish Frozen Food are urged to return it to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact the company at 1-800-938-6673 from Monday-Friday, 8 am – 4:30 pm PST.",chemical,pet feed,high content of vitamins,pet feed
2509,2016,11,9,us,"ISB Food Group, LLC Recalls Nancy’s Fancy Butterscotch Budino Gelato And Nancy’s Fancy Peanut Butter With Crunchy Peanuts Gelato With Expiration Dates Of March 18, 2017 Because Of Possible Health Risk","ISB Food Group, LLC of Los Angeles, California is recalling Nancy’s Fancy Butterscotch Budino Gelato and Nancy’s Fancy Peanut Butter with Crunchy Peanuts Gelato with expiration dates of March 18, 2017, because they were produced in a co-packing facility that has the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.
Nancy’s Fancy Butterscotch Budino Gelato and Nancy’s Fancy Peanut Butter with Crunchy Peanuts Gelato with expiration dates of March 18, 2017, were distributed from March to October 2016 in California, Oregon and Texas.
The product is in plastic pint-sized containers with the Nancy’s Fancy brand name, Butterscotch Budino flavor and Peanut Butter with Crunchy Peanuts flavor, specifically stamped on the bottom with the expiration date of March 18, 2017.
No illnesses have been reported to date, and no Nancy’s Fancy product has been found to be contaminated.
The recall is the result of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) finding samples positive for Listeria monocytogenes in the facility of the contract manufacturer, Dr. Bob’s of Upland, LLC, and in finished product of an unrelated company’s brand that was manufactured at the Dr. Bob’s facility, leading the contract manufacturer to recall all ice cream products produced this year at its facility.   The continuous production line at Dr. Bob’s that tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes was used to produce Nancy’s Fancy Butterscotch Budino and Peanut Butter with Crunchy Peanuts flavors in March of 2016.  ISB Food Group has only used the Dr. Bob’s facility for co-packing once in 2016, in March, and will not produce in the Dr. Bob’s facility going forward.
Consumers who have purchased Nancy’s Fancy Butterscotch Budino flavor or Nancy’s Fancy Peanut Butter with Crunchy Peanuts flavor with expiration dates of March 18, 2017 are urged to contact us for a full refund or any questions at (818) 405-0022, extension 103, Monday through Friday, 7:00 am Pacific Time to 3:00 pm Pacific Time.",biological,ices and desserts,listeria monocytogenes,ice cream

Recalls Nabelsi brand Thyme Because of Possible Health Risk,"Aroma Imports Inc. of Dearborn Heights, MI, is recalling 450 g and 4.5 kg packages of Nabelsi brand Thyme because the products have the potential to contain excessive levels of lead.  The recall was initiated after it was discovered that product contained high levels of lead (422 PPM) based on sampling by U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Illinois Department of Public Health, Environmental Health Protection.  Based on the product’s 30 g serving size, the calculated lead result is 12,660 µg per serving.  This level exceeds the daily limit guidelines of 6 µg per day for children, the 25 µg per day for pregnant women, and the 75 µg per day for other adults.          The recalled Nabelsi Thyme was distributed from Nov. 7, 2016 until Feb. 22, 2017 to retailers, food service establishments, and wholesalers in Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, New Jersey and Virginia.
The 450 g size (UPC: 4670000205314) is packaged in a mostly green foil/mylar bag that is not transparent on either side. The 4.5 kg size (UPC: 6670000205374) packaging is a silver foil/mylar bag. The production date for both sizes is 08/20/2016 and the expiration date is 08/20/2018. The production and expiration dates can be found on the back lower left corner of the 450 g package and back lower right of the 4.5 kg package.  The 450 g packages are packed 24 per case and the 4.5 kg packages are packed 2 per case.   Lead can accumulate in the body over time and too much of it can cause serious and sometimes permanent adverse health consequences.  People with high blood levels of lead may show no symptoms, but the condition may cause damage to the nervous system and internal organs. Acute lead poisoning may cause a wide range of symptoms, including abdominal pain, muscle weakness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and bloody or decreased urinary output. Children are particularly vulnerable to lead poisoning. Lead poisoning can be diagnosed through clinical testing.
There have been two cases of high blood levels of lead associated with this product to date. Both cases have been reported through the Illinois Department of Public Health, Environmental Health Protection.   Consumers who have purchased any packages Nabelsi Thyme should not consume the product and are urged to return them to the place of purchase for a full refund.

The main symptoms of norovirus illness are diarrhea, vomiting (children usually experience more vomiting than adults), nausea and stomach cramps. Other symptoms may include low-grade fever, headache, chills, muscle aches and fatigue (a general sense of tiredness). Most people feel better within one or two days, with symptoms resolving on their own, and experience no long-term health effects. As with any illness causing diarrhea or vomiting, people who are ill should drink plenty of liquids to replace lost body fluids and prevent dehydration. In severe cases, patients may need to be hospitalized and given fluids intravenously.

5915,2021,10,19,hk,Prepackaged egg noodle sample in breach of food labelling regulation,"Prepackaged egg noodle sample in breach of food labelling regulation The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department announced today (October 19) that a sample of prepackaged egg noodle was found to contain sulphur dioxide, a preservative which is allowed to be used in certain foods, but the functional class and name of the additive were not declared on the food label. Members of the public should not consume the affected product. The trade should also stop using or selling the affected product immediately if they possess it. Product details are as follows: Product name: Eggs Noodle (Thick) Brand: Sau Tao Place of origin: China Net weight: 454 grams per pack Sole agent: SUN SHUN FUK FOODS CO., LTD. Best-before date: December 1, 2022 ""The CFS collected the above-mentioned sample from a supermarket in Chai Wan for testing under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The test result showed that the sample contained sulphur dioxide. Although the sulphur dioxide level is below the maximum permitted level under the Preservatives in Food Regulation (Cap. 132BD), the functional class and name of the additive were not declared on the food label of the sample,"" a CFS spokesman said. ""The CFS has informed the vendor concerned and the sole agent of the irregularity, and instructed them to stop sale and remove from shelves the affected batch of product. The sole agent has initiated a recall according to the CFS' instructions. Members of the public may call its hotline at 2461 0190 during office hours for enquiries about the recall,"" the spokesman added. Sulphur dioxide is a preservative which can be used in a variety of foods including dried vegetables, dried fruits, pickled vegetables and salted fish products. Sulphur dioxide is water soluble, and most of it can be removed through washing and cooking. However, susceptible individuals who are allergic to this preservative may experience breathing difficulties, headache and nausea after consumption. The spokesman reminded the food trade that the use of preservatives in food must comply with the Preservatives in Food Regulation (Cap. 132BD). Furthermore, the Food and Drugs (Composition and Labelling) Regulations (Cap. 132W) require that for all prepackaged food for sale in Hong Kong containing sulphite in a concentration of 10 ppm or more, the functional class of the sulphite and its name shall be specified in the list of ingredients. Offenders are liable to a maximum fine of $50,000 and six months' imprisonment upon conviction. The CFS will alert the trade, continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action.
