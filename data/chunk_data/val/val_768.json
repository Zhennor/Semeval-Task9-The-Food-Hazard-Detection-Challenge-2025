Y. establishment,  is recalling approximately 204 pounds of fully cooked,  not shelf stable,  pork sausage banger products due to misbranding and an undeclared allergen,  the U. S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The firm affixed the incorrect label to the back of products on the July 6,  2016 packaging date. The products have the Banger Sausage front label but have an incorrect ingredients label for Wiener Products on the back of the package. The Banger sausages contain breadcrumbs formulated with wheat;  however,  the back label is not correct and thus,  does not sublist the breadcrumbs. Therefore,  wheat is not declared and may elicit allergic reactions in those allergic to wheat products. The pork sausage items were produced on July 5,  2016. The following product is subject to recall View Labels PDF Only 16oz. vacuumpacked packages containing Handcrafted by Joseph Brunner Wegmans Bangers 8 Bread Crumbs bearing lot number 18716 and a sellby date of 08242016.

WASHINGTON,  April 23,  2015 West Liberty Foods,  a Tremonton,  Utah establishment,  is recalling approximately 34, 075 pounds of grilled chicken breast products that may be contaminated with pieces of plastic,  the U.

        "text": "Year: 2016, Month: 10, Day: 11, Country: us, Title: outside supplier aspen hills expands cookie dough recall; blue bell recalls all products made with aspen hills cookie dough due to potential health risk - BRENHAM,  Texas Blue Bell Ice Cream is voluntarily recalling all products that were made with a cookie dough ingredient supplied by a third party supplier Aspen Hills,  Inc. ,  due to the potential for them to contain Listeria monocytogenes. Listeria monocytogenes can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children,  frail or elderly people,  and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only shortterm symptoms such as high fever,  severe headache,  stiffness,  nausea,  abdominal pain and diarrhea,  Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. No illnesses have been reported to date. Blue Bell initiated this expanded recall after Aspen Hills provided additional information on affected cookie dough lots. Although our products in the marketplace have passed our test and hold program,  which requires that finished product samples from a batch test negative for Listeria monocytogenes before the batch can be released,  Blue Bell is initiating this recall out of an abundance of caution. This recall is being conducted in cooperation with the FDA. This recall includes the following products in half gallons and pints,  Blue Bell Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough and Blue Bell Cookie Two Step sold to retail outlets,  and three gallon flavors sold to food service accounts including Blue Bell Blue Monster,  Blue Bell Chocolate Chip Cookie,  and Blue Bell Krazy Kookie Dough. These products were produced from February 2,  2016 through September 7,  2016. The consumer and food service products produced with the cookie dough pieces were distributed in the following states Alabama,  Arkansas,  Florida,  Georgia,  Kansas,  Kentucky,  Louisiana,  Mississippi,  Missouri,  New Mexico,  North Carolina,  Oklahoma,  South Carolina,  Tennessee,  Texas and Virginia. Consumers should not eat the recalled products and are encouraged to return them to the place of purchase for a full refund. We continue to work closely with our regulatory agencies,  and we remain committed to ensuring we are producing safe products for our consumers to enjoy.

FSIS has received no reports of illness due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an illness should contact a health care provider.

Chang’s Restaurants - null ConAgra Foods is expanding a voluntary recall of P. F. Changs Home Menu Brand products due to the potential presence of small metal fragments 29mm in the sugar used in the sauce. This voluntary action is being undertaken because of impacted sugar from a supplier. Foodborne foreign objects that are not hard and sharp and less than or equal to 7mm in length may cause minor injuries such as temporary reflexive choking and irritation of the gastrointestinal system. There have been no reports of adverse reactions or injuries due to consumption of these products to date. An initial recall was issued on July 7,  2016 after a ConAgra employee observed metal fragments while dispensing sugar from a supplier for a P. F. Changs Home Menu Brand sauce ingredient. On July 14,  2016,  ConAgra Foods was notified by the supplier of additional production lots of sugar that were impacted,  such that the initial recall needed to be expanded to include additional P. F. Changs Home Menu Brand meals. Products covered by this recall were distributed in the U. S. ,  specific product names and information are listed below.

Further testing is ongoing to determine if the recalled ground beef products are related to the E. coli O103 outbreak. Based on the continuing investigation,  additional product may be recalled. WASHINGTON,  April 24,  2019 Grant Park Packing,  a Franklin Park,  Ill. establishment,  is recalling approximately 53, 200 pounds of raw ground beef products that may be contaminated with E. coli O103,  the U. S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The bulk raw ground beef was produced on October 3031,  2018 and November 1,  2018. The following products are subject to recall PDF only 40lb. bulk cardboard boxes of North Star Imports Sales,  LLC. 100 GROUND BEEF BULK 80 LEAN 20 FAT marked FOR INSTITUTIONAL USE ONLY with lot code GP. 1051. 18 and pack dates 10302018,  10312018,  and 11012018. The products subject to recall bear establishment number EST. 21781 inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to Minnesota for further distribution and Kentucky for institutional use. FSIS and its public health partners,  including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and the Kentucky Department for Public Health,  have been investigating an outbreak of E. coli O103. Unopened,  intact,  packages of ground beef collected as part of the ongoing investigation tested positive for E. coli O103 at an FSIS laboratory. The sample was collected at a point of service where multiple case patients ate. At this time,  there is no definitive link between this positive product and the ongoing E. coli O103 outbreak. Furthertraceback and product analysis continues to determine if the recalled products are related to the E. coli O103 outbreak. Many clinical laboratories do not test for nonO157 STEC,  such as O103 because it is harder to identify than STEC O157H7. People can become ill from STECs 28 days average of 34 days after exposure to the organism. Most people infected with STEC O103 develop diarrhea often bloody and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment;  antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended. Most people recover within a week,  but,  rarely,  some develop a more severe infection. Hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS,  a type of kidney failure,  is uncommon with STEC O103 infection. HUS can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old,  older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. It is marked by easy bruising,  pallor and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available,  the retail distribution lists will be posted on the FSIS website atwww. fsis. usda. govrecalls. FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products,  including fresh and frozen,  and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature,  http1. usa. gov1cDxcDQ.

FSIS,  and its public health partners,  including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and the Arizona Department of Health Services,  have been conducting traceback activities for a sample of JennieO brand ground turkey in an intact,  unopened package from a casepatients home. The patient tested positive for Salmonella Reading and the sample from the ground turkey matches the outbreak strain. FSIS,  the CDC,  and state public health and agriculture partners,  have been working together on an illness cluster involving 164 casepatients in 35 states. Patients have reported eating different types and brands of turkey products purchased from many different stores,  handling raw turkey pet food andor raw turkey,  or working with live turkeys or living with someone who handled live turkeys. FSIS continues to work with the CDC and state health departments on this investigation and will provide updated information as it becomes available. Based on the continuing investigation,  additional product from other companies may also be recalled. Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis,  one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea,  abdominal cramps,  and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons,  however,  the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults,  infants,  and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider. FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.",

Wright County Egg of Galt,  Iowa is expanding its voluntary recall original recall date August 13,  2010 of specific Julian dates of shell eggs produced by their farms because they have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella. Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children,  frail or elderly people,  and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever,  diarrhea,  nausea,  vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances,  infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections,  endocarditis or arthritis. Eggs affected by the expanded recall were distributed to food wholesalers,  distribution centers and foodservice companies in California,  Arizona,  Missouri,  Minnesota,  Texas,  Georgia,  Washington,  Oregon,  Colorado,  Nevada,  Iowa,  Illinois,  Utah,  Nebraska,  Arkansas,  Wisconsin and Oklahoma. These companies distribute nationwide. Eggs are packaged under the following brand names Albertsons,  Farm Fresh,  James Farms,  Glenview,  Mountain Dairy,  Ralphs,  Boomsma,  Lund,  Kemps and Pacific Coast. Eggs are packed in varying sizes of cartons 6egg cartons,  dozen egg cartons,  18egg cartons,  and loose eggs for institutional use and repackaging with Julian dates ranging from 136 to 229 and plant numbers 1720 and 1942. Dates and codes can be found stamped on the end of the egg carton or printed on the case label. The plant number begins with the letter P and then the number. The Julian date follows the plant number,  for example P1720 223. There have been confirmed Salmonella enteritidis illnesses relating to the shell eggs and traceback investigations are ongoing. Wright County Egg is fully cooperating with FDAs investigation by undertaking this voluntary recall. Our primary concern is keeping Salmonella out of the food supply and away from consumers. As a precautionary measure,  Wright County Egg also has decided to divert its existing inventory of shell eggs from the recalled plants to a breaker,  where they will be pasteurized to kill any Salmonella bacteria present. Consumers who believe they may have purchased these shell eggs should not eat them but should return them to the store where they were purchased for a full refund. This recall is of shell eggs only. Other egg products produced by Wright County Eggs are not affected. Consumers with questions should visit www. eggsafety. org or call Wright Countys tollfree information number 8662725582,  which contains a message outlining recall instructions for consumers.

Also wash cutting boards,  dishes and utensils with hot soapy water. Clean up spills right away. Keep raw meat,  fish and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat,  poultry and egg products and cooked foods. Cook raw meat and poultry to safe internal temperatures before eating. The safe internal temperature for ground meat such as beef and pork is 160 F,  and 165 F for poultry,  as determined with a food thermometer.

Although a sample tested positive for the outbreak related strain of Salmonella,  including the identical XbaI and BlnI PFGE patterns matching the August 3 outbreak strain,  at this time,  neither FSIS nor the plant is aware of any illnesses associated with product from the above dates. An FSIS incident investigation team collected samples at the establishment following the previous recall. Todays recall occurred after a product sample collected on August 24 tested positive for the outbreak strain of Salmonella Heidelberg. The firm is recalling product from August 30 based on pending positive match samples. The products subject to recall are derived from bonein parts. These products were distributed at the retail level nationwide. Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation requests that consumers who may have purchased these products return them to the pointofpurchase.

Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis,  one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. Salmonella infections can be lifethreatening,  especially to those with weak immune systems,  such as infants,  the elderly,  and persons with HIV infection or undergoing chemotherapy. The most common manifestations of salmonellosis are diarrhea,  abdominal cramps,  and fever within 6 to 72 hours. Additional symptoms may be chills,  headache,  nausea and vomiting that can last up to seven days. The outbreak strain of Salmonella Heidelberg is resistant to several commonly prescribed antibiotics;  this antibiotic resistance may be associated with an increased risk of hospitalization or possible treatment failure in infected individuals.",

This recall is being made out of an abundance of caution due to the potential for contamination with Salmonella. The recalled products were sold on the West Coast,  at Trader Joes conventional red onions sold only in Arizona,  California,  Nevada,  and Utah stores and Ralphs conventional yellow onions sold only in California stores. The onions are sold loose in bulk bins. The red onions have a PLU sticker with the brand name Pacific Gold. No other Progressive Produce onions or other products are impacted by this recall. Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children,  frail or elderly people,  and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever,  diarrhea which may be bloody,  nausea,  vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances,  infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections i. e. ,  infected aneurysms,  endocarditis and arthritis. Retailers that received recalled product from Progressive Produce have been instructed to remove any recalled product from their shelves and to dispose of any product that is remaining in their inventory. Consumers who have purchased recalled products are urged not to consume them and to dispose of them immediately or to return them to the store for a full refund. Consumers may email Progressive Produce for further information at foodsafetyprogressiveproduce. com. Consumers with concerns about an illness from consumption of the recalled products should contact a health care provider. Progressive Produce has not received any reports of illnesses to date associated with these recalled items,  although a current illness outbreak appears to be associated with certain onions supplied to a number of companies by Thomson International. Progressive Produce is cooperating fully with FDA to facilitate the efficient recall of these onions. A photo of the red onion label is attached.",

Also wash cutting boards,  dishes and utensils with hot preferred,  soapy water and clean up any spills right away. The mechanical action of vigorous rubbing of hands and utensilssurfaces creates friction that helps to dislodge bacteria and viruses from hands and surfaces. Additionally,  warmhot water helps to dissolve fatsfoods,  aiding in cleaningmicrobe removal and can also assist in deactivation of pathogens. For more information on hand washing,  go to httpwww. cdc. gov handwashing . If soapy water is not available,  use an alcoholbased hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 alcohol. Alcoholbased hand sanitizers can reduce the number of germs on hands in some situations. However,  sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs,  including viruses. Keep raw meat,  fish and poultry away from other food that will not be thoroughly cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat,  poultry,  and their juices and thoroughly cooked foods. Thoroughly cook ground meat such as beef to an internal temperature of 160 F,  as measured with a food thermometer,  before eating. Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase one hour if temperatures exceed 90 F. Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking. Since the issuance of the Public Health Alert,  FSIS has learned that Sysco was contacted by the Canadian firm and began notifying their customers on March 20. FSIS was unaware of the firms actions and proceeded with the Public Health Alert out of an abundance of caution. Imported products were produced by New Food Classics of Burlington,  Ontario and were imported by Sysco Seattle Inc. ,  for distribution to restaurants in Arizona,  Colorado,  Texas and Washington. Consumers with questions should contact Susan Linn at 832. 489. 1799. Media with questions about the recall should contact Charley Wilson at 2815842423. E. coli O157H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause bloody diarrhea,  dehydration,  and in the most severe cases,  kidney failure. The very young,  seniors and persons with weak immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness. FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products,  including fresh and frozen,  and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature.",

The recall is being expanded due to a newlyreported illness that appears to have stemmed from the consumption of raw dough or batter linked to flour produced last fall. Guidance from the Food and Drug Administration FDA and the Centers for Disease Control CDC continues to warn that consumers should refrain from consuming any raw products made with flour. E. coli O121 is eliminated by heat through baking,  frying,  sautéing or boiling products made with flour. All surfaces,  hands and utensils should be properly cleaned after contact with flour or dough. Although most strains of E. coli are harmless,  others can make you sick. E. coli O121 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause bloody diarrhea and dehydration. Seniors,  the very young,  and persons with compromised immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness. Anyone diagnosed by a physician as having an illness related to E. coli O121 is also urged to contact state and local public health authorities. The recall affects the following retail flour products. It includes 8 SKUs stock keeping units or UPC codes of Gold Medal Flour,  1 SKU of Signature Kitchens Flour and 1 SKU of Gold Medal Wondra flour. If you have any of the products listed below,  they should be thrown away. Consumers with additional questions or requesting a replacement should contact the company at 8002308103.

The CFSs initial investigations showed that the affected batch of product had been imported to Hong Kong. For prudences sake,  the spokesman urged the public not to consume the affected batch of the product concerned and to observe personal,  food and environmental hygiene. The trade should also stop using or selling the affected batch of the product immediately if they possess it. Product details are as follows Product name Frozen beef offals abomasum Brand COTO Place of origin Argentina Expiry date March 25 to July 16,  2023 A spokesman for the CFS said,  The CFS noted an announcement from the Department of Food Safety of Macao earlier that an imported frozen beef abomasum sample from Argentina had tested positive for the COVID19 virus. The CFS immediately contacted the Macao authority and local importers for followup. Initial investigations found that PMI Hong Kong Food Services Limited had imported the affected batch of frozen beef abomasum. For the sake of prudence,  the CFS has instructed the importer concerned to stop sale of the affected batch of the product,  and initiate a recall. Members of the public may call the importers hotline at 3922 7300 during office hours for enquiries about the recall. The CFS will mark and seal the affected batch of frozen beef abomasum and arrange its disposal. The CFS will continue to follow up on the incident and step up sampling of similar products for testing. To prevent the import of the COVID19 virus through imported frozen foods,  the CFS has stepped up precautionary testing measures since mid2020,  including enhanced testing of various types of frozen foods and their packaging imported from different countriesregions,  which involves taking samples at the Airport Food Inspection Offices and cold stores of importers. Up to now,  over 37, 000 samples of food and their packaging have been collected for testing for the virus,  and only the pomfret fish and packaging samples announced last August,  the cuttlefish slice and packaging samples announced last November,  the packaging samples of beef and pork skin announced this February and the packaging samples of ox offal and chicken leg announced this April were found to be positive. The CFS will continue the sampling of imported frozen foods and their packaging for testing. The COVID19 virus is predominantly transmitted through droplets and cannot multiply in food or food packaging. According to current scientific knowledge,  the World Health Organization and food safety assessment authorities in overseas countries consider that it is unlikely that the COVID19 virus can be transmitted to humans via food consumption. Nevertheless,  members of the public should always observe personal,  food and environmental hygiene. The CFS reminds the public to pay attention to the following Always keep hands clean,  particularly before touching the mouth,  nose or eyes;  Rub hands with liquid soap for at least 20 seconds when washing before and after handling chilled and frozen food and its packaging,  if any;  after going to the toilet;  and before eating;  Handle raw and cooked food separately,  and pay special attention when handling raw meat and offal,  to avoid crosscontamination of food;  and Cook food thoroughly and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products.

Further testing is ongoing to determine if the recalled ground beef products are related to the E. coli O103 outbreak. Based on the continuing investigation,  additional product may be recalled. WASHINGTON,  April 23,  2019 K2D Foods,  doing business as DBA Colorado Premium Foods,  a Carrolton,  Ga. establishment,  is recalling approximately 113, 424 pounds of raw ground beef products that may be contaminated with E. coli O103,  the U. S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The raw ground beef items were produced on March 26,  March 29,  April 2,  April 5,  April 10,  and April 12,  2019. The following products are subject to recall View LabelsPDF only Two 24lb. vacuumpacked packages in cardboard boxes containing raw GROUND BEEF PUCK with Use Thru dates of 41419,  41719,  42019,  42319,  42819,  and 43019. The products subject to recall bear establishment number EST. 51308 inside the USDA mark of inspection on the boxes. These items were shipped to distributors in Ft. Orange,  Fla. and Norcross,  Ga. for further distribution to restaurants. FSIS and its public health partners,  including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and the Tennessee Department of Health,  have been investigating an outbreak of E. coli O103. Unopened,  intact ground beef collected as part of the ongoing investigation from a restaurant location,  where multiple casepatients reported dining,  tested positive for E. coli O103. At this time,  there is no definitive link between this positive productand the ongoing E. coli O103 outbreak. Further traceback and product analysis continues to determine if the recalled products are related to the E. coli O103 outbreak. Many clinical laboratories do not test for nonO157 STEC,  such as O103 because it is harder to identify than STEC O157H7. People can become ill from STECs 28 days average of 34 days after exposure to the organism. Most people infected with STEC O103 develop diarrhea often bloody and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment;  antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended. Most people recover within a week,  but,  rarely,  some develop a more severe infection. Hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS,  a type of kidney failure,  is uncommon with STEC O103 infection. HUS can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old,  older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. It is marked by easy bruising,  pallor and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately. FSIS is concerned that some product may be in refrigerators or freezers of restaurants. Restaurants that have purchased these products are urged not to serve them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available,  the retail distribution lists will be posted on the FSIS website atwww. fsis. usda. govrecalls. FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products,  including fresh and frozen,  and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160F. The only way to confirm that raw ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature,  http1. usa. gov1cDxcDQ.

S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The RTE pork carnitas bowls were produced between Oct. 1014,  2018. The following products are subject to recall View Labels PDF only 11oz. clear plastic wrapped bowls of PORK CARNITAS BOWL packages with a sell by dates of 101518 through 101918. The products subject to recall bear establishment number EST. 34834 inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations in Oregon and Washington. The problem was discovered on October 15,  2018 when Taylor Farms Northwest received notification that fireroasted diced tomatillos used in the production of their pork carnitas bowls was being recalled by their tomatillos supplier due to Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella concerns. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider. Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis,  one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea,  abdominal cramps,  and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons,  however,  the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis,  a serious infection that primarily affects older adults,  persons with weakened immune systems,  and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly,  persons outside these risk groups are affected. Listeriosis can cause fever,  muscle aches,  headache,  stiff neck,  confusion,  loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women,  the infection can cause miscarriages,  stillbirths,  premature delivery or lifethreatening infection of the newborn. In addition,  serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higherrisk categories who experience flulike symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food. FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers refrigerators. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available,  the retail distribution lists will be posted on the FSIS website at www. fsis. usda. govrecalls.

The products produced with the chocolate chip cookie dough pieces were distributed in the following ten states Alabama,  Georgia,  Kentucky,  Louisiana,  Mississippi,  North Carolina,  South Carolina,  Tennessee,  and Virginia. No illnesses have been reported to date. Blue Bell identified a potential problem through intensified internal testing and notified Aspen Hills. Aspen Hills then issued a voluntary recall of the products supplied to Blue Bell. Although our products in the marketplace have passed our test and hold program,  which requires that finished product samples test negative for Listeria monocytogenes,  Blue Bell is initiating this recall out of an abundance of caution.

Members of the public should not consume the affected batch of the product. The trade should also stop using or selling the affected batch of the product immediately if they possess it. Product details are as follows Product name Frozen Raw Caribbean Spiny Lobster Tail Brand Royal Banquet Distributor The Food Source Ltd Place of origin Brazil Net weight 340 grams per pack Bestbefore date May 3,  2022 The CFS collected the abovementioned sample of frozen lobster from an online shop for testing under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The test result showed that the sample contained sulphur dioxide at a level of 704 parts per million ppm,  exceeding the legal limit of 100 ppm. The functional class and name of the additive were also not declared on the food label,  a CFS spokesman said. The CFS has informed the vendor concerned of the irregularity,  and instructed the vendor concerned to stop sale and remove from shelves the affected batch of the product. The distributor concerned has initiated a recall according to the CFS instructions. Members of the public may call its hotline at 3422 8718 during office hours for enquiries about the recall.

Sulphur dioxide is water soluble,  and most of it can be removed through washing and cooking. However,  susceptible individuals who are allergic to this preservative may experience breathing difficulties,  headache and nausea after consumption. The spokesman reminded the food trade that the use of preservatives in food must comply with the Preservatives in Food Regulation Cap. 132BD. Furthermore,  the Food and Drugs Composition and Labelling Regulations Cap. 132W require that for all prepackaged food for sale in Hong Kong containing sulphite in a concentration of 10 ppm or more,  the functional class of the sulphite and its name shall be specified in the list of ingredients.

P. ,  a Quebec,  Canada establishment,  is recalling approximately 6, 804 pounds of readytoeat RTE ham products that may be contaminated with Salmonella Enteritidis,  the U. S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The ham items were packaged on November 5,  2020. The following products are subject to recall View LabelsPDF Only 12lb. plastic film vacuum package of Celebrity EXTRA LEAN IMPORTED HAM 98 FAT FREE with product codes 20309 11 91,  20309 21 91,  20309 31 91,  20309 41 91 or 20309 51 91 printed on the side of the packaging. The products subject to recall bear Canadian establishment number 180 inside the Canadian inspection mark located below the ingredient list. These items were shipped to distributors in California for further distribution for institutional use. The problem was discovered when FSIS collected a routine product import sample that confirmed positive for the presence of Salmonella Enteritidis. The product subject to recall was determined by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency CFIA to be associated with the FSIS positive sample result. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider. Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis,  one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea,  abdominal cramps,  and fever within 6 hours to 6 days after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons,  however,  the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults,  infants,  and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider. FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers refrigerators or freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

Wright County Egg of Galt,  Iowa is adding one Californiadistributed brand label Cardenas Market to its voluntary recall of August 13,  2010 of specific Julian dates of shell eggs produced by their farms because they have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella. Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children,  frail or elderly people,  and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever,  diarrhea,  nausea,  vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances,  infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections,  endocarditis or arthritis. The eggs affected were ultimately distributed to Cardenas Market stores in California and Nevada. They were packaged in 60egg cases that were overwrapped with plastic. Although the Cardenas Market label wasnt named in the original recall announcement,  Cardenas was immediately notified at the time of the original recall,  and product in distribution or in stores has been quarantined,  returned or destroyed. Eggs included in the recall are labeled with plant number 1026 and Julian dates ranging from 136 to 228. Dates and codes can be found printed on the label. The plant number begins with the letter P and then the number. The Julian date follows the plant number,  for example P1026 228. There have been confirmed Salmonella enteritidis illnesses relating to the shell eggs and traceback investigations are ongoing. Wright County Egg is fully cooperating with FDAs investigation by undertaking this voluntary recall. Our primary concern is keeping Salmonella out of the food supply and away from consumers. As a precautionary measure,  Wright County Egg also has decided to divert its existing inventory of shell eggs from the recalled plants to a breaker,  where they will be pasteurized to kill any Salmonella bacteria present. Consumers who believe they may have purchased these shell eggs should not eat them but should return them to the store where they were purchased for a full refund. This recall is of shell eggs only. Other egg products produced by Wright County Eggs are not affected. Consumers with questions should visit www. eggsafety. org or call Wright Countys tollfree information number 8662725582,  which contains a message outlining recall instructions for consumers.",

The problem was discovered on October 16,  2018 when GH Foods CA,  LLC received notification that the corn used in the production of their readytoeat salads with chicken was being recalled by their corn supplier due to Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella concerns. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider. Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis,  one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea,  abdominal cramps,  and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons,  however,  the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis,  a serious infection that primarily affects older adults,  persons with weakened immune systems,  and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly,  persons outside these risk groups are affected. Listeriosis can cause fever,  muscle aches,  headache,  stiff neck,  confusion,  loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women,  the infection can cause miscarriages,  stillbirths,  premature delivery or lifethreatening infection of the newborn. In addition,  serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higherrisk categories who experience flulike symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food. FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers refrigerators. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them.

J. establishment,  is recalling approximately 120, 872 pounds of ground beef products that may be contaminated with E. coli O103,  the U. S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The ground beef products were produced from February 1,  2022,  through April 8,  2022. The complete list of products and product codes for the beef products that are subject to recall can be found here. Labels for the ground beef products can be found here. The products subject to recall bear establishment number EST. 46841 inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations nationwide. The problem was discovered during routine FSIS testing of imported products. There have been no confirmed reports of illness or adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Many clinical laboratories do not test for nonO157 Shiga toxinproducing E. coli STEC such as O103 because it is harder to identify than STEC O157H7. People can become ill from STECs 28 days average of 34 days after consuming the organism. Most people infected with STEC O103 develop diarrhea often bloody and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment;  antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended. Most people recover within a week,  but,  rarely,  some develop a more severe infection. Hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS,  a type of kidney failure,  is uncommon with STEC O103 infection. HUS can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old,  older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. It is marked by easy bruising,  pallor and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately. FSIS is concerned that some products may be in consumers refrigerators or freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

Products produced under the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture,  Trade,  and Consumer Protection WDATCP inspection program are eligible for sale within the state of Wisconsin when they bear the Wisconsin state inspection shield on the immediate package. The products being recalled,  however,  incorrectly bear the Cooperative Interstate Shipment CIS program version of the USDA Mark of Inspection,  which requires federal acceptance into the program.

S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. Recommendations for Preventing Salmonellosis Wash hands before and after handling raw meat and poultry with warmhot preferred or cold soapy running water by rubbing hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds. Also wash cutting boards,  dishes and utensils with hot preferred,  soapy water and clean up any spills right away. The mechanical action of vigorous rubbing of hands and utensilssurfaces creates friction that helps to dislodge bacteria and viruses from hands and surfaces. Additionally,  warmhot water helps to dissolve fatsfoods,  aiding in cleaningmicrobe removal and can also assist in deactivation of pathogens. For more information on hand washing,  go to httpwww. cdc. govhandwashing. If soapy water is not available,  use an alcoholbased hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 alcohol. Alcoholbased hand sanitizers can reduce the number of germs on hands in some situations. However,  sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs,  including viruses. Keep raw meat,  fish and poultry away from other food that will not be thoroughly cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat,  poultry,  and their juices and thoroughly cooked foods. Thoroughly cook raw meat and poultry to safe internal temperatures 160 F for ground meat such as beef and pork and 165º F for all poultry,  as measured with a food thermometer before eating. Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase one hour if temperatures exceed 90 F. Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking. The products subject to recall areVarious size packages of ground beef These products were produced between Dec. 4,  2012,  and Dec. 9,  2012,  and distributed to a restaurant in Macomb County,  Mich. ,  and sold directly to consumers at Jouni Meats,  Inc. These products were sold without a label. This recall has been initiated because of concerns involving a cluster of Salmonella Typhimurium illnesses that may be associated with consumption of raw ground beef from a restaurant in Macomb County,  Mich. Working in conjunction with the Michigan Department of Community Health,  Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development,  Arizona Department of Health Services,  and the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC,  FSIS determined that there is a link between the ground beef products from Jouni Meats,  Inc. and this illness cluster. Based on epidemiologic and traceback investigations,  7 casepatients with the same outbreak strain have been identified in Ariz. and Mich. with illness onset dates ranging from December 9,  2012,  to December 13,  2012. The 7 casepatients consumed raw beef kibbeh on December 7,  2012,  and December 8,  2012. It is not known at this time if this outbreak strain has any drug resistance;  results are pending. FSIS is continuing to work with public health partners and CDC on this investigation. FSIS will continue to provide information as it becomes available. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers freezers. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks including at restaurants to ensure that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause Salmonella,  one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. Salmonella infections can be lifethreatening,  especially to those with weak immune systems,  such as infants,  the elderly,  and persons with HIV infection or those undergoing chemotherapy. The most common manifestations of salmonellosis are diarrhea,  abdominal cramps,  and fever within 12 to 72 hours. Additional symptoms may be chills,  headache,  nausea and vomiting that can last up to seven days. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact a health care provider.",

Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever,  diarrhea,  nausea,  vomiting and abdominal pain. The organic ginger supplier reported this finding from another customer. The Republic of Tea and the organic ginger supplier have conducted their own investigations and have tested numerous samples of organic ginger by accredited independent third party laboratories and confirmed the absence of Salmonella. Despite the fact it was confirmed that there is no Salmonella in the organic ginger that was tested,  The Republic of Tea is taking the precautionary measure to recall the following Organic Turmeric Ginger Green Tea Citizens may return Organic Turmeric Ginger Green Tea to The Republic of Tea for a replacement tea,  or for a full refund.

Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever,  diarrhea which may be bloody,  nausea,  vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances,  infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections i. e. ,  infected aneurysms,  endocarditis and arthritis. Golden International Corporation also warns consumers,  food distributors,  grocery stores,  and food processors not to consume or sell certain cartons of stolen tilapia. A container of frozen tilapia ready for reexport to Taiwan was stolen from Golden International Corporations container yard in Renton,  WA,  and was recovered in Everett,  WA. Product is likely to have been sold in the surrounding area by the thieves,  however is not limited to only Everett. Container was stolen around 440pm on Sunday April 29,  2018 and was not recovered until May 9,  2018. The container may not have been refrigerated properly and tilapia may be subject to temperature abuse. The container underwent routine sampling by Michelson Laboratories to determine health safety and Salmonella was detected. With this knowledge,  the entire shipment could be compromised and was loaded for reexport. However,  local trucking was unable to deliver it to the port before the weekend. It was therefore left in the lot at Golden International and subsequently carried off using a stolen truck. The master case label of stolen tilapia is read FROZEN TILAPIA FISH IQFFARM RAISED MANUFACTURER NO. 7F3001PACKED FOR GOLDEN INTERNATIONAL PRODUCT OF TAIWAN NET WEIGHT 40 LBS. Of 405 stolen cartons,  336 cartons contain frozen whole round tilapia and each fish weighs over 1500 grams 3. 3 lbs. and remaining 69 cartons contain frozen whole round tilapia and each fish weighs over 800 grams 1. 76 lbs. . No illnesses have been reported to date. This notice is being made with the knowledge of the U. S. Food and Drug Administration FDA. Consumers who have purchased stolen tilapia in surrounding areas and in Everett,  WA since April 29,  2018 are urged to destroy it. If the product was used to make other foods,  consider recalling it and contact the FDA Recall Coordinator.

Irwindale,  CA is recalling 702 cases of the Baby Spinach variety of Spinach Temptations 6 oz. bagged salads with Useby Dates of July 4 with Product Code 11707B,  IR127121 and July 8 with Product Code 12007B,  IR130373 because they could be contaminated by Escherichia coli 0157H7 Ecoli 0157. H7. The recall extends only to products with this Useby Date or Product Code sold in the following states California,  Washington and Arizona. No other Ready Pac Foods,  Inc. products are included in the recall. No illnesses related to these products have been reported. Ready Pac is collaborating closely with the FDA. The recall notification is being issued out of an abundance of caution based on a confirmed positive result for Ecoli 0157H7 in a random sample test conducted by the FDA. Ecoli 0157H7 is an organism that may cause diarrheal illness often with bloody stools. Although most healthy adults can recover completely within a week,  some people can develop a form of kidney failure called Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome HUS. HUS is most likely to occur in young children and the elderly. The condition can lead to serious kidney damage and even death. Because it is still possible that products bearing the Useby Dates of July 4 and July 8 with the above Products Codes could be on store shelves,  this recall extends to retailers as well as consumers. Ready Pac believes that it is important to alert consumers and retailers who might still possess one of the potentially affected salads to dispose of it immediately. Ready Pac Foods,  Inc. has earned an outstanding safety record for over 40 years and has taken immediate precautionary measures to protect public health by issuing this voluntary recall and removing product from the market.

S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS is issuing a public health alert for raw frozen New Orleans Roasted Chicken Wings products imported and labeled with a false USDA mark of inspection. A recall was not requested because the known affected product is no longer available in commerce for consumers to purchase. DiDa DiDa USA Corp. ,  a Saratoga,  Calif. ,  establishment received,  and distributed ineligible imported frozen chicken wings products from The Peoples Republic of China to U.

The products were shipped to one retail location and then further distributed to 20 different retail locations in California,  Oregon,  and Washington. The frozen chicken wings products are labeled with a false USDA mark of inspection bearing P40478,  an establishment number that does not exist. The problem was discovered when FSIS received a consumer complaint reporting a product suspected of being illegally imported being sold at a location. After investigation,  FSIS determined that the product was ineligible and misbranded with a false USDA mark of inspection. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about a reaction should contact a healthcare provider. FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers freezers. Retailers who have purchased the product are urged not to sell it. Consumers who purchased the product should not consume it and properly discard it. Consumers are asked to double bag the product when discarding it to reduce the possibility of animals accessing the product because USDA cannot confirm whether the chicken wings were properly heated to control pathogens of concern to domestic livestock.

Preliminary investigation found that the abovementioned importer had imported into Hong Kong the affected batch of the product concerned. The importer had stopped sale and removed from shelves the affected batch of the product. It has also initiated a recall according to the CFS instructions. Members of the public may call the relevant importers hotline at 2606 8658 during office hours for enquiries about the recall. Peanuts are a known food allergen. Those who are allergic to it may develop symptoms like vomiting,  diarrhoea,  asthma and rash upon consumption. In severe cases anaphylactic shock may even develop. As for other members of the public,  generally speaking,  they would not be subject to such reactions when the food in question is consumed,  the spokesman said. The spokesman urged consumers who are allergic to peanuts not to consume the affected batch of the products. Those who feel unwell after consuming them should seek medical treatment. The Food and Drugs Composition and Labelling Regulations Cap 132W require that all prepackaged food for sale in Hong Kong should list out the foods ingredients in its label. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of 50, 000 and six months imprisonment. The CFS will alert the trade,  continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action.

Some products bear a different establishment number on the label due to further processing and some products may have been served from the deli counter in retail stores. Labels for the products made with the recalled chicken are available here. We encourage consumers to check the FSIS website frequently while we continue to update the press release andor the labels if we become aware of additional products that used the recalled chicken. July 8,  2021,  Editors Note Details of this recall were updated to reflect additional date codes and an increase in product poundage from approximately 8, 492, 832 pounds to approximately 8, 955, 296 pounds. The recalled product names and product codes remain the same. While the product was distributed to schools,  it resulted from a commercial sale and was not part of food provided by the USDA for the National School Lunch Program. WASHINGTON,  July 3,  2021 Tyson Foods Inc. ,  a Dexter,  Mo. establishment,  is recalling approximately 8, 955, 296 pounds of readytoeat RTE chicken products that may be adulterated with Listeria monocytogenes,  the U. S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The frozen,  fully cooked chicken products were produced between December 26,  2020 and April 13,  2021. The products that are subject to recall are listed here. View the labels here. The products subject to recall bear establishment number EST. P7089 on the product bag or inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped nationwide to retailers and institutions,  including hospitals,  nursing facilities,  restaurants,  schools and Department of Defense locations. On June 9,  2021,  FSIS was notified of two persons ill with listeriosis. Working in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and state public health partners,  FSIS determined there is evidence linking the Listeria monocytogenes illnesses to precooked chicken produced at Tyson Foods Inc. The epidemiologic investigation identified three listeriosis illnesses,  including one death,  between April 6,  2021 and June 5,  2021. During routine sample collection,  FSIS collected two precooked chicken samples from two establishments that are closely related genetically to Listeria monocytogenes from ill people. One of the samples was collected at Tyson Foods Inc. FSIS is continuing to work with federal and state public health partners to determine if there are additional illnesses linked to these products. Additional information on the investigation may be found on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis,  a serious infection that primarily affects older adults,  persons with weakened immune systems,  and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly,  persons outside these risk groups are affected. Listeriosis can cause fever,  muscle aches,  headache,  stiff neck,  confusion,  loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women,  the infection can cause miscarriages,  stillbirths,  premature delivery or lifethreatening infection of the newborn. In addition,  serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higherrisk categories who experience flulike symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food. FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumer and institutional freezers. Consumers should not eat these products. Institutions should not serve these products. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.",

For humans,  nausea,  gastrointestinal disturbances and vomiting have been reported. Updated on 2 June 2020 Subsequent to announcing earlier that a sample of a bottled apple juice drink was found to be contaminated with patulin,  the CFS detected patulin at a level of 120 parts per billion ppb in another sample of a different kind of bottled fruit juice drink of the same brand taken from the market during followup investigations. The test result exceeded the action level of 50 ppb adopted by the CFS which is the same as the standard of the Codex Alimentarius Commission on patulin in apple juice.

Expands Previously Announced Voluntary Recall of Pet Food Products Due to Potential Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes Health Risks to Humans and Animals - Bravo Packing,  Inc. of Carneys Point,  NJ is expanding the previously announced voluntary recall of two pet food products to now include all pet food and bones in all package sizes. During an FDA inspection,  samples collected tested positive for Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes and resulted in a recall due to the potential health risks to humans and pets. Bravo Packing,  Inc. is expanding the recall due to potential cross contamination. Full list of products below. Salmonella can cause illness in pets eating the products,  as well as people who handle contaminated pet food products,  especially if they have not thoroughly washed their hands after having contact with the products,  infected pets,  or any surfaces exposed to these products. People infected with Salmonella should monitor themselves for some or all of the following symptoms nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea or bloody diarrhea,  abdominal cramping,  and fever. Rarely,  Salmonella can result in more serious ailments,  including arterial infections,  endocarditis an infection of the heart muscle,  arthritis,  muscle pain,  eye irritation,  and urinary tract symptoms. People who have these symptoms after having contact with the products identified in this recall or with a pet that has eaten these products should contact their healthcare providers. A pet with a Salmonella infection may be lethargic and have diarrhea or bloody diarrhea,  fever,  and vomiting. Some pets will have decreased appetite,  fever,  and abdominal pain. If your pet has consumed the recalled products and has these symptoms,  please contact your veterinarian. Pets exposed to contaminated food can be infected without showing symptoms. Infected pets,  including those without symptoms,  can also shed Salmonella through their feces and saliva,  spreading pathogens into the home environment and to humans and other animals nearby. Listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children,  frail or elderly people,  and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only shortterm symptoms such as high fever,  severe headache,  stiffness,  nausea,  abdominal pain,  and diarrhea,  Listeria monocytogenes infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. No human or animal illnesses related to the identified products have been reported to date. Bravo Packing Inc. generally works with distributors that fill orders to retail stores and to consumers directly nationwide. Consumers with any of the affected products should handle them with caution,  discard products in a secure container,  and wash hands and surfaces properly.

The test result showed that the sample contained Bacillus cereus at a level of 4 600 000 per gram. Under the Microbiological Guidelines for Food,  if readytoeat food contains Bacillus cereus at a level of more than 100 000 per gram,  it is considered unsatisfactory. Action Taken by the Centre for Food Safety The CFS had informed the manufacturer and the vendor concerned of the test result. Investigation was conducted at the production plant and the supermarket concerned and followup samples were collected for further testing. Investigation is ongoing. The CFS had also provided health education on food safety and hygiene for the staff of the production plant and the supermarket and requested them to carry out thorough cleaning and disinfection. The CFS will alert the trade,  continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action in order to safeguard public health and food safety. Advice to the Trade According to Section 54 of the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance Cap 132,  all food available for sale in Hong Kong,  locally produced or imported,  should be fit for human consumption. An offender is subject to a maximum fine of 50, 000 and imprisonment for six months upon conviction. Advice to Consumers Bacillus cereus is commonly found in the environment. Unhygienic conditions in food processing and storage may give rise to its growth. Consuming food contaminated with excessive Bacillus cereus may cause gastrointestinal upset such as vomiting and diarrhoea.

Check to see if you have the recalled products in your home. Recalled products should be thrown out or returned to the store where they were purchased. Food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes may not look or smell spoiled but can still make you sick. Symptoms can include vomiting,  nausea,  persistent fever,  muscle aches,  severe headache and neck stiffness. Pregnant women,  the elderly and people with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild,  flulike symptoms,  the infection can lead to premature delivery,  infection of the newborn or even stillbirth. In severe cases of illness,  people may die.

To date,  no illnesses have been reported to the Department in connection with this product. The product is packaged in various sizes of sealed flexible plastic packaging,  displaying the plant number 361315,  with a code of 101. The consumer alert affects all packages with this code. This product was sold at the Cooperstown Farmers Market 101 Main St. Cooperstown,  NY during late December 2017 and early January 2018 and at the Sunflower Natural Foods Market 75 Mill Hill Rd. Woodstock,  NY 12498 starting on January 10,  2018. A routine sample of the cheese,  taken by an inspector from the Division of Milk Control and Dairy Services on February 20,  2018,  was subsequently tested by the New York State Food Laboratory and discovered to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. On February 23,  2018,  the manufacturer was notified of a preliminary positive test result and voluntarily recalled the product from all their customers. Test results were confirmed on March 2,  2018. The cheese will be destroyed by the manufacturer.

The beef jerky products may contain monosodium glutamate MSG that is not declared on the finished product labels. The readytoeat teriyaki beef jerky items were packaged and produced on June 7,  2018. The following products are subject to recallView LabelPDF only 0. 48 lbs. tray packages containing Tillamook Country Smoker Teriyaki Beef Jerky with lot code 11588 and best by unopeneddate 030919. The products subject to recall bear establishment number 9295 inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to distribution centers in Utah and North Carolina. The problem was discovered on July 5,  2018 by the firm during a routine label review.

When notified of the positive result on Wednesday,  the company immediately recalled the cheese. The cheese was distributed only to Costco stores in Colorado. Mauri Gorgonzola cheese is packaged in clear plastic in approximately 1 lb. wedges. The recalled cheese can be identified by the following information contained on a white sticker on the package DISTRIBUTED BY DPI Specialty Foods Tualatin,  OR,  ITALY 34449 with sell by dates of 011311 or 011411. The Costco item number is 34449. Consumers who have any of this cheese should not eat it. They should return it to the place of purchase or dispose of it in a closed plastic bag and place it in a sealed trash can to prevent people or animals,  including wild animals,  from eating the product. Colorado and several other state health departments,  the CDC,  and the FDA have been investigating an outbreak of E. coli O157H7 infections among people who sampled or purchased cheeses that were part of a Cheese Road Show at Costco stores Oct. 1417. The gorgonzola cheese was tested as part of this outbreak investigation. However,  the DNA fingerprint of this cheese does not match the outbreak strain and appears to be a separate incident. To date,  no illnesses associated with this gorgonzola cheese have been identified;  however,  consumers are cautioned not to eat this cheese. Most people infected with E. coli O157H7 develop diarrhea and abdominal cramps,  but some illnesses may last longer and can be more severe. While most people recover within a week,  some may develop a severe infection. Rarely,  a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome can occur as symptoms of diarrhea improve;  this can happen at any age but is most common in children under 5 years old and in older adults. People with hemolytic uremic syndrome should be hospitalized immediately,  as their kidneys may stop working and they may be at risk for other serious health problems. State health officials urged individuals experiencing signs or symptoms of E. coli O157H7 to immediately contact their health care provider. Health care providers also should immediately report any suspected infection to state or local public health authorities. Costco has removed the cheese from its stores and using card purchase records,  has notified consumers by phone of the situation. Consumers with questions may contact DPI Specialty Foods at 18005973876.",

Symptoms can include abdominal pain,  vomiting,  lethargy,  irritability,  weakness,  behavior or mood changes,  delirium,  seizures,  and coma. However,  infants,  young children and the developing fetus can be affected by chronic exposure to amounts of lead that may not result in obvious symptoms of lead poisoning. A child with lead poisoning may not look or act sick. Lead poising in children can cause learning disabilities,  developmental delays,  and lower IQ scores.

Preliminary investigations revealed that an importer,  Best Spirits Co Ltd,  had imported 2, 800 cartons of the affected batch of the product,  with some 100 cartons reexported to Macau,  and the remaining distributed in Hong Kong. Bromate is the ionic form of bromic acid in aqueous solution. The bromate in drinking water is formed during ozonation process of water. If a large amount of bromate is consumed,  people may experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea,  vomiting and abdominal pain. It may also affect the kidney and nervous system in severe cases. Although there is evidence suggesting that bromate can cause cancer in animals,  there is not yet sufficient data confirming that it can cause cancer in humans. Action Taken by the Centre for Food Safety The CFS immediately contacted major local importers and retailers for followup. The importer concerned has initiated a recall of the affected batch of product according to CFS instructions. The CFS will alert the trade,  continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action. Investigation is ongoing. Advice to the Trade The trade should also stop using or selling the product concerned immediately if they possess it. According to Section 54 of the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance Cap 132,  all food for sale in Hong Kong,  locally produced or imported,  should be fit for human consumption. An offender is subject to a maximum fine of 50, 000 and imprisonment for six months upon conviction. Advice to Consumers Members of the public may call the importers hotline 2378 2563 or 2378 2561 during office hours for enquiries about the recall.

Ltd. Best before date December 30,  2018 Reason For Issuing Alert The CFS collected the abovementioned sample of sharks tail skin from a supermarket in Causeway Bay for testing under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The test result showed that it contained mercury at a level of 4. 16 parts per million ppm,  exceeding the legal limit of 0. 5 ppm. Mercury may affect the nervous system,  particularly the developing brain. At high levels,  mercury can affect foetal brain development,  and affect vision,  hearing,  muscle coordination and memory in adults. Action Taken by the Centre for Food Safety The CFS has alerted the trade and will continue to follow up on the case and take appropriate action. Advice to the Trade Stop selling the affected product should they possess it. Advice to Consumers Not to consume affected batch of the product. People are advised to maintain a balanced and varied diet. To avoid health risks posed by excessive intake of metallic contaminants,  pregnant women,  women planning pregnancy and young children should avoid eating large or predatory fish. As some international organisations such as the World Health Organization have pointed out,  consuming predatory fish species is the main source of mercury intake for human beings. The report of the CFS Total Diet Study has also pointed out that large fish or predatory fish species may contain high mercury levels for example,  tuna,  alfonsino,  shark,  swordfish,  marlin,  orange roughy and king mackerel. Hence,  groups particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of mercury,  such as pregnant women,  women planning pregnancy and young children,  should opt for fish that are smaller in size for consumption and avoid consumption of the abovementioned types of fish which may contain high mercury levels to minimise the health risk posed to the foetus,  infants and young children by excessive exposure to metal contaminants in food.

The products were produced June 12,  Aug. 14,  Sept. 4,  and Oct. 24,  2013 and were sold at a single San Francisco retail location. The products have a shelf life of one year.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and to ensure that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever,  diarrhea which may be bloody,  nausea,  vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances,  infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections i. e. ,  infected aneurysms,  endocarditis and arthritis. Listeria monocytogenes is an organism,  which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children,  frail or elderly people,  and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only shortterm symptoms such as high fever,  severe headache,  stiffness,  nausea,  abdominal pain and diarrhea,  Listeria monocytogenes infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.

The Hostess Brands products subject to the recall were produced using the Grain Craft flour that has now been recalled and,  as a result,  these products may contain low levels of undeclared peanut residue. More information about the Grain Craft recall can be found on the FDAs website at httpwww. fda. govFoodRecallsOutbreaksEmergenciesSafetyAlertsAdvisoriesucm504002. htm. While those who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to peanuts run the risk of serious or lifethreatening allergic reaction if they consume products containing peanut allergens,  the amount of peanut exposure from use of the flours and affected products is considered to be low and not expected to cause adverse health effects in the vast majority of peanut allergic consumers. To date,  Hostess has received notice of two allergic reactions related to the product covered by this recall. Out of an abundance of caution,  we are recalling the specific products listed on the attachment. This recall applies only to the products listed. This recall does not affect any other Hostess Brands products. The Hostess Brands products affected by the recall include single serve snack cakes and donuts,  multipack boxes and bagged donuts.

After investigation,  the CFS noted that another kind of affected chocolate product Product 2 had also been imported to Hong Kong. Salmonella infection may cause fever and gastrointestinal upset such as vomiting,  abdominal pain and diarrhoea. The effects on infants,  young children,  the elderly and persons with a weak immune system could be more severe and may even lead to death. Action Taken by the Centre for Food Safety The CFS has been closely following up on the notices issued by the Food Standards Agency of the UK and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland on the recall of Kinder products due to possible contamination by Salmonella. Upon learning of the incident,  the CFS immediately followed up with major local importers and retailers,  and learnt during followup investigation that another importer had also imported the concerned product Product 1. In addition,  the Ministry for Primary Industries of New Zealand also issued notice on the recall of other Kinder products due to possible contamination by Salmonella. After investigation,  the CFS noted that another kind of chocolate product Product 2 had also been imported to Hong Kong. The importers concerned have stopped sale and removed from shelves the affected products and initiated recalls. The CFS has stepped up testing of related products as well as alerting the trade to the incident,  and will continue to follow up,  closely liaise with overseas authorities and take appropriate action. Investigation is ongoing. Advice to the Trade Stop using or selling the products concerned immediately if they possess them. Advice to Consumers Not to consume the affected products if they have bought any.

S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The following products are subject to recall Various weight packages of cured pork products,  including country style bacon,  sliced bacon,  ham,  sliced ham,  and summer sausages The recalled products are in consumersized packages in various weights,  and are wrapped in white butcher paper with the name and address of BenLee as well as the mark of inspection and the name of the product in a contrasting ink color. The recalled products bear the establishment number Est. 2366 inside the USDA mark of inspection. The products were produced prior to March 14,  2013,  and were distributed in northwest Kansas for further distribution. The problem was discovered by the Kansas State Department of Agriculture in conjunction with FSIS. Some fully cooked products were given the mark of inspection,  but the company does not have a HACCP plan for fully cooked product. Further investigation revealed that other ReadyToEat or heattreated products were produced without HACCP plans. HACCP plans,  in which establishments identify potential hazards associated with a given product,  and identify a means of addressing those hazards in the production process,  are required for all products bearing the mark of inspection. FSIS and the company have received no reports of illness at this time. Anyone concerned about an illness from consumption of these products should contact a healthcare provider. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify that recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

WASHINGTON,  Jan. 17,  2015 La Guadalupana Wholesale,  Inc. ,  a Chicago,  Ill. ,  establishment,  is recalling approximately 8, 856 pounds of chicken tamales because they were not produced under a fully implemented ReadyToEat RTE Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points HACCP plan;  a Listeria monocytogenes Lm program;  and a hazard analysis,  the U. S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The recall is being edited to include an additional 1, 248 pounds of chicken tamales produced from Dec. 1,  2014,  through Jan. 5,  2015 with the establishment number P6794 inside the USDA mark of inspection. On Jan. 17,  2015,  the company recalled 8, 856 pounds of chicken tamales produced from Dec. 1,  2014,  through Jan. 5,  2015. To read the recall release,  click here. The following products listed below were included in the initial recallLabels PDF Only 2 packs of 6 tamales in each vacuumpacked bag of LA GUADALUPANA CHICKEN TAMALES The products bear the establishment number P21094 inside the USDA mark of inspection with packaging dates from Nov. 19,  2014 through Jan. 4,  2015 on the label. The products were produced from Dec. 1,  2014 through Jan. 5,  2015,  and then packaged using a Cryovac machine by a copacker of La Guadalupana Wholesale from Nov. 19,  2014 through Jan. 2,  2015. La Guadalupana Wholesales copacker did not conduct a hazard analysis to determine the food safety hazards reasonably likely to occur in the cryovacing process and did not identify the preventive measures the establishment could apply to control those hazards. The chicken tamales are a RTE product and fall within the Fully Cooked Not Shelf Stable category. As such,  their production requires an Lm program. The product is also processed by means of physical handling and packaging,  thus further requiring a HACCP plan. They were distributed for retail sale in Chicago,  Ill. The problem was discovered by an FSIS inspector,  who was conducting a sanitation task in the copackers establishment and saw plant personnel handling the RTE product in a room where raw product is also handled. An investigation was conducted and found that the copacker had not conducted an RTE hazard analysis,  developed or implemented a HACCP plan for the chicken tamales,  or developed and implemented an Lm testing program. Thus,  there is no assurance the products are wholesome and;  therefore,  safe for consumption. Consequently,  the products may support the growth of pathogens that may be detrimental to health. FSIS and the company have received no reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available,  the retail distribution lists will be posted on the FSIS website atwww. fsis. usda. govrecalls.

Although healthy individuals may suffer only shortterm symptoms such as high fever,  severe headache,  stiffness,  nausea,  abdominal pain,  and diarrhea,  Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. Consumers can identify the recalled Vidalia Onions by the purchase location,  PLU 4159 and Little Bear brand on the PLU sticker as provided in the table at the end of the notice. The recalled Vidalia Onions are sold in bulk in the produce section of retail stores. The recalled Little Bear onions were available for sale to consumers on June 23 and 24 at Wegmans stores in the Rochesterarea,  Massachusetts,  and at the Erie West and Erie Peach Street Wegmans stores in Pennsylvania.

No other onions are included in this recall notice. To date,  no illnesses or adverse events have been reported. The company shipped the recalled product directly to retailer distribution centers in Florida,  North Carolina,  and Pennsylvania. The distribution centers further distributed the recalled product to retail stores in Florida,  Georgia,  New York,  Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. The recall comes after internal company testing detected Listeria on a single pack line. Although the company cleans and sanitizes its pack lines regularly,  it is recalling onions packed on the implicated packing line before and after June 21 out of an abundance of caution. No other products grown,  packed,  or sold by AM Farms are affected by this recall. Anyone who has the recalled product in their possession should not consume it. The product should be disposed and may return to the place of purchase with a receipt for a refund. Consumers with questions may contact the companys information desk at 19125852058,  MF,  8 am 4 pm EDT. AM Farms immediately notified customers who received the recalled product directly from the company and requested that they remove it from inventory. As a result,  the product was available for retail purchase only at the stores and during the dates listed in the table. AM Farms is issuing this press release and keeping the U. S. Food and Drug Administration and Georgia Department of Agriculture informed of its recall process to assure that consumers are properly alerted. The health and safety of consumers are our top priorities here at AM Farms. We are glad that most of the implicated product never reached stores,  but we are focused intently on alerting consumers in those areas that did receive the onions. said Aries Haygood,  coowner of AM Farms. We stopped packing on the implicated line,  and I am personally overseeing a full cleaning and sanitation of the equipment and an internal review of our processes.

PREPARING GROUND BEEF FOR SAFE CONSUMPTION USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline 1888MPHOTLINE or visit www. fsis. usda. gov Wash hands with warm,  soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw meat and poultry. Wash cutting boards,  dishes and utensils with hot,  soapy water. Immediately clean spills. Keep raw meat,  fish and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat,  poultry and egg products and cooked foods. Consumers should only eat ground beef or ground beef patties that have been cooked to a safe internal temperature of 160 F. Color is NOT a reliable indicator that ground beef or ground beef patties have been cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria such as E. coli O157H7. The only way to be sure ground beef is cooked to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use a thermometer to measure the internal temperature. Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase or one hour if temperatures exceed 90 F. Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking. The products subject to recall bears the establishment number EST. 9400 inside the USDA mark of inspection. These products were produced on June 11,  2010,  and were shipped to distribution centers in Connecticut and Maryland for further distribution. It is important to note that the above listed products were repackaged into consumersize packages and sold under different retail brand names. When available,  the retail distribution lists will be posted on FSIS website at www. fsis. usda. gov FSIS_Recalls Open_Federal_Cases index. asp . FSIS and the establishment are concerned that consumers may also freeze the product before use and that some product may still be in consumers freezers. FSIS strongly encourages consumers to check their freezers and immediately discard any product subject to this recall. FSIS became aware of the problem on August 5,  2010 when the agency was notified by the Maine Department of Agriculture,  Food and Rural Resources of an E. coli O26 cluster of illnesses. In conjunction with the Maine Department of Health and Human Services,  Maine Department of Agriculture,  Food and Rural Resources,  the New York State Department of Health,  and New York State Department of Agriculture Markets,  two 2 casepatients have been identified in Maine,  as well as one 1 casepatient in New York with a rare,  indistinguishable PFGE pattern as determined by PFGE subtyping in PulseNet. PulseNet is a national network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC. Illness onset dates range from June 24,  2010,  through July 16,  2010. FSIS determined that there is an association between the ground beef products subject to recall and the cluster of illnesses in the states of Maine and New York. FSIS regulations and statute allow the agency to take action on a product under its jurisdiction in cases where the product is convincingly associated to illness by evidence collected though an epidemiological,  traceback investigation,  andor laboratory analysis. FSIS is continuing to work with affected state public health partners and the company on the investigation. E. coli O26 is a bacterium that can cause bloody diarrhea,  dehydration,  and in the most severe cases,  kidney failure. The very young,  seniors and persons with weak immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness.",

WASHINGTON,  June. 7,  2018 Supermercado Selectos,  a San Sebastián,  Puerto Rico firm,  is recalling an undetermined amount of various raw,  frozen Siluriformes fish,  beef,  pork and poultry products that were produced without the benefit of federal inspection,  the U.

The raw,  frozen Siluriformes fish,  beef,  pork,  chicken and turkey items were produced on various dates from August 2017 to May 31,  2018. The complete list of products and UPC code numbers can be found here. Supermercado Selectos shipped the items to DGA Food Service,  LLC,  who further distributed the items to Head Start Child and Adult Care Food Programs in Puerto Rico. USDA provides reimbursement for meals served in Head Start through the Child and Adult Care Food Program CACFP;  however,  these products were purchased commercially. These meat and poultry products were not provided or purchased by USDAs Food and Nutrition Service. The problem was first discovered during routine inspection by FSIS investigators on May 23,  2018. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an illness should contact a health care provider. FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers refrigerators or freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them.

The problem was discovered when a broker notified the firm. The firm investigated and found that the ingredient label on the bottom of the packages was incorrect,  due to improper placement. The firm observed that although the correct principal display panel labels were attached to the top of the packages;  the wrong ingredients statement label was attached to the bottom of the packages. The Turkey Meatloaf with Kale products incorrectly display the ingredients statement for the Homestyle Meatloaf. The Turkey Meatloaf with Kale products contain the allergens milk and anchovies,  which are not declared because the Homestyle Meatloaf does not contain those ingredients and the ingredients statement,  therefore,  does not declare milk or anchovies. Conversely,  the Homestyle Meatloaf products incorrectly display the ingredients statement for the Turkey Meatloaf with Kale. Although all of the allergen ingredients in the Homestyle Meatloaf are declared on the bottom label,  the Homestyle Meatloaf product is a beef and pork product,  and beef and pork are not included in the ingredients statement on the bottom of the package.

The basterma,  sausage,  soujouk,  salami,  mortadella,  makanek,  bologna,  Lahmajun meat pie and other sausagelike items were produced on various dates between Jan. 1,  2015 and Aug. 4,  2016.

The major public health concerns include listing hydrolyzed plant protein in the ingredient statement of thebeef bologna and beef mortadella,  but not specifying that soy,  an allergen,  is the source of that protein. Also,  the beef mortadella products did not declare pistachio nut,  an allergen,  on individual package ingredient statements,  although some cases of the product display a sticker stating Pistachio was in the product. FSIS also found that beef salami and beef bologna products contained poultry ingredients and a sausage product tested positive for Red Dye 40,  which is not declared on product labels.

Recalls ReadytoEat Chicken and Pork Hot Dog Products Due to Possible Listeria Contamination Espis Sausage and Tocino Co. FSIS Announcement WASHINGTON,  Sept. 28,  2021 Espis Sausage and Tocino Co. ,  a Seattle,  Wash. establishment,  is recalling approximately 2, 048 pounds of frozen readytoeat chicken and pork hot dog products that may be adulterated with Listeria monocytogenes,  the U. S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The frozen readytoeat chicken and pork hot dog product was produced on May 19,  2021. The following products are subject to recall view the labels here 12oz vacuum packed plastic packages containing Argentina MIGHTY MEATY CHICKEN AND PORK HOTDOG JUMBO and SELL BY 051922. The products subject to recall bear establishment number EST. P17524 inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to a distributor in California and further distributed to retail locations. The problem was discovered by FSIS during an assessment of the establishments sampling records that indicated the firm received confirmation from their thirdparty lab that a product contact surface had returned positive for Listeria monocytogenes. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider. Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis,  a serious infection that primarily affects older adults,  persons with weakened immune systems,  and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly,  persons outside these risk groups are affected. Listeriosis can cause fever,  muscle aches,  headache,  stiff neck,  confusion,  loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women,  the infection can cause miscarriages,  stillbirths,  premature delivery or lifethreatening infection of the newborn. In addition,  serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higherrisk categories who experience flulike symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food. FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available,  the retail distribution lists will be posted on the FSIS website atwww. fsis. usda. govrecalls. FSIS advises those at increased risk of foodborne illness to reheat hot dogs to a minimum internal temperature of 165F or until steaming hot before eating,  due to the threat of listeriosis. The only way to confirm that hot dogs are cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature,  httpswww. fsis. usda. govsafetempchart.

House of Flavors is taking these measures following an announcement from the peanut ingredient supplier Peanut Corporation of America PCA that its products may possibly be contaminated with salmonella. Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children,  frail or elderly people,  and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever,  diarrhea which may be bloody,  nausea,  vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances,  infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections i. e. ,  infected aneurysms,  endocarditis and arthritis.

The following products are subject to recall View Labels 5oz individually plasticwrapped packages of Dutch Farms Chicken with Broccoli Cheese with lot code BR 1055 and BEST IF USED BY FEB 24 2023. 5oz individually plasticwrapped packages of MILFORD VALLEY CHICKEN WTH BROCCOLI CHEESE with lot code BR 1055 and BEST IF USED BY FEB 24 2023. 10oz box of two individually plasticwrapped packages of MILFORD VALLEY CHICKEN CORDON BLEU with lot code CB 1055 and BEST IF USED BY FEB 24 2023. 5oz individually plasticwrapped packages of KIRKWOOD Raw Stuffed CHICKEN,  BROCCOLI CHEESE with lot code BR 1055 and BEST IF USED BY FEB 24 2023. 5oz individually plasticwrapped packages of KIRKWOOD Raw Stuffed CHICKEN CORDON BLEU with lot code CB 1056 and BEST IF USED BY FEB 25 2023. The products subject to recall bear establishment number P 2375 inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to distributors nationwide. FSIS has been working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and public health partners to investigate a multistate outbreak of 28 Salmonella Enteritidis illnesses in 8 states,  with onset dates ranging from February 21 through June 28,  2021. Unopened intact packages of raw,  frozen,  breaded chicken stuffed with broccoli and cheese were collected from an ill persons home and tested positive for the outbreak strain of Salmonella Enteritidis. FSIS continues to work with the CDC and state and local public health partners on this investigation. Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis,  one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea,  abdominal cramps,  and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons,  however,  the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults,  infants,  and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider. The products of concern may appear to be readytoeat but are in fact raw and need to be fully cooked according to the manufacturer cooking instructions on the package before consumption. The labels for these products identify cooking instructions for preparation in an oven. The products should not be prepared in the microwave or air fryer. FSIS advises all consumers that particular attention needs to be taken to safely prepare and cook these frozen,  raw poultry products to a temperature of 165 F. The only way to confirm raw poultry products are cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature,  as indicated in this chart. Additionally,  FSIS advises all consumers to keep raw poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use one cutting board for raw poultry and a separate one for fresh produce and cooked foods. FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.",
