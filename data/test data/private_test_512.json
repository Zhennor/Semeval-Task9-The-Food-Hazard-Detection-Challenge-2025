S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service announced today. The ground beef products were produced on Aug. 8 and packaged in various sizes. The packages are labeled PORTERS GROUND BEEF NOT TO EXCEED 20 FAT,  with a SELL BY date of 080900;  GROUND ROUND NOT TO EXCEED 15 FAT,  with a SELL BY date of 081000;  and CERT. ANGUS BEEF,  GROUND ROUND,  NOT TO EXCD 15 FAT,  with a SELL BY date of 081000. Because of the potential hazard of foodborne illness from consumption of meat products contaminated with harmful pathogens,  we urge consumers who have purchased the suspect product not to eat it and return it to the place of purchase,  said Thomas J. Billy,  FSIS administrator. This is an opportunity to remind consumers to always follow the safe handling instructions required on all raw meat and poultry products and cook ground beef to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F. The problem was discovered through routine FSIS microbiological sampling. E. coli O157H7 is a potentially deadly pathogen that can cause bloody diarrhea and dehydration. The very young,  the elderly,  and persons with compromised immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness. FSIS has received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of this product. Anyone concerned about an illness should contact a physician. Consumers and media with questions about the recall may contact Carolyn White,  communications manager,  BelAir supermarket,  at 18007253977,  ext. 6211. Consumers with food safety questions can phone the tollfree USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 18005354555. The hotline can be reached from 10 a. m. to 4 p. m. Eastern Time Monday through Friday,  and recorded food safety messages are available 24 hours a day. NOTE Access news releases and other information at the FSIS Web site at httpwww. fsis. usda. gov. PREPARING GROUND BEEF FOR SAFE CONSUMPTION Consumers should only eat ground beef patties that have been cooked to a safe temperature of 160 F. When a ground beef patty is cooked to 160 F throughout,  it can be safe and juicy,  regardless of color.",

Color is not a reliable indicator that ground beef patties have been cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria such as E. coli O157H7. Eating a pink or red ground beef patty without first verifying that the safe temperature of 160 F has been reached is a significant risk factor for foodborne illness. Thermometer use to ensure proper cooking temperature is especially important for those who cook or serve ground beef patties to people most at risk for foodborne illness because E. coli O157H7 can lead to serious illness or even death. Those most at risk include young children,  the elderly,  and those with compromised immune systems.",

January 16,  2009 Peanut Corporation of America PCA,  a peanut processing company and maker of peanut butter for bulk distribution to institutions,  food service industries,  and private label food companies,  today announced an expanded recall of peanut butter produced in its Blakely,  Georgia processing facility as well as the voluntary recall of peanut paste produced in the same plant because these products have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella. The company on January 13,  2009 previously announced the recall of 21 lots of peanut butter produced on or after July 1,  2008. Todays announcement and voluntary recall affect all peanut butter produced on or after August 8,  2008 and peanut paste produced on or after September 26,  2008 at the Georgia facility. The peanut butter being recalled is sold by PCA in bulk packaging in containers ranging in size from five to 1, 700 pounds. The peanut paste is sold in sizes ranging from 35 pound containers to tanker containers. PCA is notifying customers who received the recalled product by telephone or in writing,  as well as through the news media and a tollfree 247 hotline number. None of the peanut butter or peanut paste being recalled is sold directly by PCA to consumers through retail stores. Today,  the FDA informed PCA that new product samples in unopened containers tested positive for Salmonella,  said Stewart Parnell,  President of Peanut Corporation of America. The FDA has not yet confirmed the DNA fingerprints of these positive samples to match the strains causing the outbreaks of food borne illness in several states. PCA is immediately stopping all production at the Blakely,  Georgia facility and notifying its customers to recall and retain all affected product produced during these dates at this plant. We deeply regret that this product recall is expanding and our first priority is to protect the health of our customers. Our company has worked around the clock for the last week with federal regulators to help identify any potential problems. Our Blakely facility is currently not operating as we continue to work with federal food safety investigators, Parnell said. Customers should call 18775647080 for further instructions on what to do with the product or visit the company web site at www. peanutcorp. com. Eating food contaminated with Salmonella can result in abdominal cramping,  diarrhea,  and fever.",

Johnson today advised consumers who purchased raw milk from Stump Acres Dairy of New Salem,  York County,  to immediately discard the raw milk due to the risk of contamination with salmonella. Raw milk is milk that has not been pasteurized or homogenized. We are working very closely with the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture to conduct local public health investigations,  Dr. Johnson said. If you have any raw milk from Stump Acres Dairy at home,  do not drink the milk and immediately discard it. Individuals who drank raw milk purchased from Stump Acres Dairy and became ill are advised to consult with their physician and are also urged to contact their local health department. If no illness occurred,  it is not necessary to seek medical attention,  but consumers should still discard the raw milk. This consumer advisory is based on reports to the Department of Health about two confirmed cases and one probable case of Salmonella Typhimurium infection among York County residents who drank raw milk from Stump Acres Dairy in February. Additional cases of illness are suspected. The Department of Agriculture has suspended sales of raw milk at the dairy and is ensuring that corrective action is taken and that multiple laboratory samples come back negative for Salmonella before raw milk sales can resume. As part of the investigation,  the Department of Agriculture obtained three positive milk cultures from the dairy. A milk sample obtained from consumers also tested positive at the Department of Healths Bureau of Laboratories. Stump Acres Dairy has a customer base of about 250 clients. The customers of the dairy are known to be from Pennsylvania,  Maryland and Virginia. No cases of salmonella infection have been identified at this time in the other states. The shelflife for raw milk is about 14 days but can be longer if the milk is frozen. Freezing of the milk will not kill the salmonella bacteria. Salmonella is a bacterial infection that affects the intestinal tract and can sometimes affect the bloodstream and other organs. It is one of the most common causes of gastroenteritis,  which can include diarrhea and vomiting. Approximately 2, 000 cases of salmonella are reported each year in Pennsylvania. Onset of illness usually occurs in 24 to 72 hours and patients typically recover in 5 to 7 days.",

The recalled mangoes,  a product of Mexico,  were sold as individual fruit and can be identified by the Daniella brand sticker and one of the following PLU numbers 3114,  4051,  4311,  4584 or 4959. The recalled mangoes were sold at various retail stores throughout the U. S. between July 12 and August 29,  2012. Mangoes have been linked to a number of recent cases of salmonellosis in Canada,  and may be linked to cases in California and perhaps other states. Although an investigation is still ongoing,  out of an abundance of caution Splendid Products is recalling Daniella mangoes in the U. S. The recall is being conducted in consultation with the U. S. Food and Drug Administration FDA and the California Department of Public Health. The most common symptoms of salmonella are diarrhea,  abdominal cramps and fever,  which develop within eight to 72 hours of eating contaminated food. The illness usually lasts four to seven days and most people recover without treatment. However,  salmonellosis can be severe or even lifethreatening for infants,  older people,  pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems. Consumers who believe they may have contracted a Salmonella infection should contact a healthcare provider. Those who have bought the recalled mangoes are advised not to eat them and to discard them. If there is no identifying sticker on the mango,  consider discarding or returning the product to the place of purchase. A copy of this press release with related photos of the product is available on the company website at this address www. splendidmangos. com . The products involved in this voluntary recall are Mangoes sold as individual fruit with the sticker brand Daniella at various retail stores throughout the U. S. between July 12 and August 29,  2012. We want to let everyone know our top priority is public safety,  said Splendid Products general manager Larry Nienkerk. We have notified all of our customers and we are working with all the government agencies that are involved. We didnt want to wait.",

Announces an Expansion of its Voluntarily Limited Recall of Almond Butter and Peanut Butter To Add Cashew Butter, Tahini and Roasted Blanched Peanut Products - UPDATED FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE September 24,  2012 Sunland,  Inc. today announced a voluntary recall of its Almond Butter and Peanut Butter,  which it has now expanded to include its Cashew Butter,  Tahini and Roasted Blanched Peanut Products. This recall is limited to products manufactured between May 1,  2012 and September 24,  2012. These products may be contaminated with Salmonella,  an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children,  frail or elderly people,  and those with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever,  diarrhea which may be bloody,  nausea,  vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances,  infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections i. e. ,  infected aneurysms,  endocarditis and arthritis. The voluntary recall was initiated after learning that between June 11,  2012 and September 2,  2012,  twentynine people reported Salmonella Bredeney PFGE matching illnesses in approximately 18 states,  including Washington,  California,  Arizona,  Texas,  Louisiana,  Missouri,  Illinois,  Minnesota,  Michigan,  Pennsylvania,  Massachusetts,  New York,  Rhode Island,  North Carolina,  Virginia,  Connecticut,  New Jersey and Maryland,  according to a report issued on September 22,  2012 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC. There is nothing more important to us than the health and safety of our customers,  particularly the many families who enjoy our peanut butter everyday. While FDA,  CDC,  and State Health Agencies investigate to confirm the cause of illnesses reported,  as a precautionary step,  we have decided to voluntarily recall our Almond Peanut and Cashew Butters,  Tahini and Roasted Blanched Peanut products manufactured between May 1,  2012 and September 24,  2012. If you purchased these products,  do not eat them. Please return the product to your supermarket for a full refund or dispose of it. Statement of Jimmie Shearer,  President and CEO of Sunland,  Inc. The recall is being conducted in cooperation with the U. S. Food and Drug Administration FDA. No other Sunland products are affected by this recall. The products were distributed nationally to numerous large supermarket chains and were available for purchase on the internet. The specifics of the affected products are as follows The UPC is located on the side of the jars label below the bar code.",

The recalled White Herring was distributed in New York State in uncoded,  16 oz. clear plastic bags. The White Herring is a product of China. The White Herring was sampled by a New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets Food Inspector during a routine inspection. Subsequent analysis of the product by New York State Food Laboratory personnel confirmed that the White Herring was not properly eviscerated prior to processing. The sale of uneviscerated fish is prohibited under New York State Agriculture and Markets regulations because Clostridium botulinum spores are more likely to be concentrated in the viscera than any other portion of the fish. Uneviscerated fish have been linked to outbreaks of botulism poisoning. This product may be contaminated with Clostridium botulinum spores,  which can cause Botulism,  a serious and potentially fatal foodborne illness. Symptoms of botulism include blurred or double vision,  general weakness,  poor reflexes,  difficulty in swallowing and respiratory paralysis. No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem. Consumers that have purchased White Herring are advised not to eat it and should return it to the place of purchase.

Coli O157:H7 Contamination - WASHINGTON,  Sep. 12,  2013 National Beef Packing Company,  a Dodge City,  Kan. ,  establishment,  is recalling approximately 690 pounds of beef tongue root filet products that may be contaminated with E. coli O157H7,  the U. S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The following products are subject to recall 30lb. boxes of National Beef Beef Tongue Root Filet,  Product Code 12753. These products bear the establishment number EST. 262 inside the USDA mark of inspection and include a pack date of 081913A. The products were produced on August 19,  2013,  and were shipped to a distributor in Amarillo,  Texas,  for further processing. The problem was discovered through routine FSIS monitoring which confirmed a positive result for E. coli O157H7. An investigation determined National Beef Packing Company was the sole supplier of the source materials used to produce the positive product. FSIS and the company have received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of these products. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact a healthcare provider. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers including restaurants of the recall and to ensure that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available,  the retail distribution lists will be posted on the FSIS website athttpwww. fsis. usda. govrecalls. E. coli O157H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause bloody diarrhea,  dehydration,  and in the most severe cases,  kidney failure. The very young,  seniors and persons with weak immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness. FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products,  including fresh and frozen,  and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature. Consumers with questions should contact the company at 18778574143,  or visit National Beefs website at www. nationalbeef. com for details about the recall and the companys return and reimbursement policy. Media with questions regarding the recall should contact National Beefs Spokesperson,  Keith Welty,  at 816 7138631.

S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The Chicken salad product,  in threepound bags,  was produced on April 24,  2014,  and shipped to Schnucks retail grocery locations for deli distribution in Illinois,  Indiana,  Iowa,  Missouri and Wisconsin. The following product is subject to recall 3lb. sealed plastic bags containing CURRY WHITE MEAT CHICKEN SALAD WITH WALNUTS. View Label PDFOnly Because the products were sold at deli counters,  consumer packaging may vary. Plastic containers in various sizes may bear a purchase date between April 24,  2014 and May 2,  2014. Bulk case labels or packaging may bear the case code 0989674 or 0963124 as well as establishment number EST. P13562 inside the USDA mark of inspection. The problem was discovered when routine product sampling by FSIS personnel tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes on April 28,  2014. This product was held by the firm and did not enter commerce. Further investigative sampling by the company later determined bulk walnuts from an outside supplier,  an ingredient used in the product,  may have been contaminated with the pathogen. FSIS and the company have received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of these products. FSIS is working in partnership with the Food and Drug Administration to further investigate the source of the contamination. Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis,  a serious infection that primarily affects older adults,  persons with weakened immune systems,  and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly,  persons outside these risk groups are affected. Listeriosis can cause fever,  muscle aches,  headache,  stiff neck,  confusion,  loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women,  the infection can cause miscarriages,  stillbirths,  premature delivery or lifethreatening infection of the newborn. In addition,  serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higherrisk categories who experience flulike symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers freezers.",

S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The products subject to recall include 40lb. cases containing two,  roughly 20lb. cryovac packages of bonein Rain Crow Ranch Ribeye bearing the establishment number EST. 2316 inside the USDA mark of inspection with the following production dates 9513,  91013,  91113,  92613,  10213,  1032013,  11813,  112213,  121713,  122613,  122713, 11614,  11714,  12314,  13114,  21314,  21414,  22114,  22814,  3814,  32014,  4414 or 42514 printed on the box. Quartered beef carcasses stamped with the USDA mark of inspection and establishment number EST. 2316. The products were produced and packaged on various dates between September 2013 and April 2014. The bonein ribeye roasts were the source material of concern. Fruitland American Meat advises that the bonein ribeye roasts were distributed to a restaurant in New York,  NY,  and a Whole Foods distribution center in Connecticut which services its stores in New England. The quartered carcasses were distributed to an FSISinspected establishment in Missouri for further processing and distribution,  and to a restaurant in Kansas City,  Mo. All products would have been processed into smaller cuts with no identifying consumer packaging. The problem was discovered by FSIS during a review of company slaughter logs. The problem may have occurred as a result of the way some company employees were recording information and determining the age of various cattle. Dorsal root ganglia,  branches of the nervous system located in the vertebral column are considered specified risk materials SRMs and must be removed from cattle 30 months of age and older in accordance with FSIS regulations. SRMs are tissues that may contain the infective agent in cattle infected with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy BSE,  as well as materials that are closely associated with these potentially infective tissues. Therefore,  FSIS prohibits SRMs from use as human food to minimize potential human exposure to the BSE agent. Every animal received antemortem inspection by an FSIS Public Health Veterinarian. This involves observing each animal at rest and in motion and there is no indication that any of the cattle slaughtered displayed any signs of BSE.",

Working in conjunction with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC,  FSIS determined that there is a link between ground beef purchased at Whole Foods Market and this illness cluster. Based on epidemiologic investigation,  3 casepatients have been identified in Massachusetts with illness onset dates ranging from June 13,  2014 to June 25,  2014. While the onset of illnesses was in June,  on August 13,  2014,  additional laboratory results provided linkages between the 3 MA casepatients and ground beef purchased from Whole Foods. Traceback investigation indicated that all 3 casepatients consumed ground beef purchased from 2 Whole Foods Market prior to illness onset. FSIS is continuing to work with state and federal public health partners on this investigation to determine a common source and will provide updated information as it becomes available. E. coli O157H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration,  bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 28 days 34 days,  on average after exposure the organism. While most people recover within a week,  some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS. This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising,  pallor,  and decreased urine output.",

S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The frozen Chicken Breast Grilled Strips product was produced on August 5,  2014,  and then shipped to retail warehouse locations in California,  Texas,  Utah,  and Washington state. The following product is subject to recall 3. 25lb. Plastic resealable bags containing frozen Chicken Breast Grilled Strips. The affected product packaging will bear the establishment number P33901 as well as a Best by Date of 080515. The problem was discovered during the companys routine inplant inspection. While some of the product was set aside and held,  the product subject to this recall was inadvertently shipped.

Less commonly,  persons outside these risk groups are affected. Listeriosis can cause fever,  muscle aches,  headache,  stiff neck,  confusion,  loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women,  the infection can cause miscarriages,  stillbirths,  premature delivery or lifethreatening infection of the newborn. In addition,  serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higherrisk categories who experience flulike symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers freezers. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

General Mills recall can be found at httpwww. fda. govSafetyRecallsucm509693. htm Many clinical laboratories do not test for nonO157 Shiga toxinproducing E. coli STEC,  such as STEC O121 because it is harder to identify than STEC O157. People can become ill from STECs 28 days average of 34 days after consuming the organism. Most people infected with STEC O121 develop diarrhea often bloody,  and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment;  antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended.

It is marked by easy bruising,  pallor,  and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

As part of Hampton Creeks testing program,  30 Native Forest Coconut Milk Powder samples were pulled and tested. 29 of the samples tested negative and one sample tested positive for Salmonella. 74 additional samples taken from other lots of the Native Forest Coconut Milk Powder tested negative. No other Hampton Creek products were affected,  and there have been no reports of any health issues. All finished mixes released into the market tested negative for any pathogens,  but with the presence of Salmonella in the Native Forest Coconut Milk Powder,  we notified the FDA of the potential health risk. Consumers who have purchased any of the recalled products should not consume the product,  and either discard it or return it to the retailer for a full refund. Nothing else matters without safety,  said Hampton Creeks Founder and CEO,  Josh Tetrick. The guidance weve received from the FDA has been vital to ensuring any affected product is removed from the marketplace. You can reach me directly any time at 415. 404. 2372 or the company at 844. 423. 6637,  MF 9006pm PST,  and wecarehamptoncreek. com with any and all questions or concerns. With the health and safety of consumers being the companys top priority,  Hampton Creek decided to inform the FDA of the Native Forest Coconut Milk Powder concern 2 days before the confirmed test result.",

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis,  a serious infection that primarily affects older adults,  persons with weakened immune systems,  and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly,  persons outside these risk groups are affected. Listeriosis can cause fever,  muscle aches,  headache,  stiff neck,  confusion,  loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women,  the infection can cause miscarriages,  stillbirths,  premature delivery or lifethreatening infection of the newborn. In addition,  serious and sometimes fatal infections can occur in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higherrisk categories who experience flulike symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food. FSIS and the company are concerned that some of this recalled product may be in food service distribution refrigerators. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them.

In addition to observing poor sanitation practices,  FDA took environmental samples that identified Listeria monocytogenes in 18 environmental samples from Apple Trees processing,  packaging,  and storage areas,  including foodcontact surfaces such as a cheese slicer,  cheese mold,  tables,  and plates used to hold cheese before packaging. FDA also tested Apple Trees goat cheese. Two of the finished goat cheeses and 18 of the environmental samples tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes. On September 20,  2016,  Apple Tree initiated a voluntary recall of the four lots of goat cheeses that PDA tested and found positive for Listeria monocytogenes. Later in September,  Apple Tree expanded its recall to include all of its goat cheeses,  but FDA is not aware of any public notification to consumers announcing the expanded recall. Accordingly,  FDA is issuing this release and working with PDA to monitor this situation and take appropriate actions to protect consumers from Apple Tree goat cheeses that may have been exposed to or contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. Listeriosis is a rare but serious illness usually caused by eating food contaminated with the bacteria called Listeria monocytogenes. Anyone who experiences fever and muscle aches,  sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms,  or develops fever and chills while pregnant should tell their health care provider about eating a potentially contaminated food. Symptoms can appear from a few days up to a few weeks after consumption of the contaminated food. Read more about food safety tips for expectant mothers httpwww. fda. govfoodfoodborneillnesscontaminantspeopleatriskucm083320. htm Listeriosis,  the third leading cause of death from food poisoning,  targets pregnant women and their fetuses,  people with weakened immune systems,  and those 65 years of age or older. Listeriosis hits these highrisk groups the hardest,  accounting for at least 90 percent of reported Listeria infections and resulting in higher rates of hospitalization and death than most other foodborne bacteria. In pregnant women,  listeriosis can cause miscarriage,  stillbirth,  premature labor,  and serious illness or death in newborn babies. Retailers and restaurants should not serve or sell any Apple Tree goat cheeses and should dispose of them. If they do not know the source of their goat cheeses,  they should check with their distributor or Apple Tree.",

Retailers,  restaurants,  and other food service operators who have processed and packaged any Apple Tree goat cheeses need to be concerned about crosscontamination of cutting surfaces and utensils through contact with the potentially contaminated products. Regular frequent cleaning and sanitizing of cutting boards and utensils used in processing may help to minimize the likelihood of crosscontamination. Listeria can grow at refrigeration temperatures in foods. Listeria can also crosscontaminate other food cut and served on the same cutting board or stored in the same area. Retailers,  restaurants,  and other food service operators may wish to consider whether other foods available for sale could have been crosscontaminated from Apple Tree goat cheeses,  and should be discarded. Firms who have relabeled,  repacked,  or used these Apple Tree goat cheeses to produce new products that have not received a thermal kill step should contact the FDA Recall Coordinator in your state to determine whether or not you should initiate a recall of your products. FDA District Recall Coordinators for each state are listed at httpwww. fda. govSafetyRecallsIndustryGuidanceucm129334. htm. The FDA urges consumers to not eat any Apple Tree goat cheeses,  to check their homes for the cheeses,  and to throw them away.

WASHINGTON,  March 19,  2017 H B Packing Co. ,  Inc. ,  a Waco,  Texas establishment,  is recalling approximately 79, 461 pounds of boneless beef products that may be contaminated with E. coli O103,  the U. S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. The boneless beef items were produced on March 6,  2017. The following products are subject to recallLabel 60lb. box containing boneless beef with case code 69029 and production date 030617. Multiple combo bins containing 73, 682lbs of boneless beef with case code 69029 and production date 030617. Two combo bins containing 4, 095lb of Beef Chuck with case code 73033 and production date 030617. Combo bin containing 1, 624lb of Beef 94S Combos with case code 118078 and production date 30617. The products subject to recall bear establishment number EST. M13054 inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to food manufacturers within the state of Texas. The problem was discovered when FSIS was notified by the State of Texas Meat Safety Assurance Unit about a positive nonO157 Shiga toxinproducing E. coli sample. There have been no confirmed reports of illnesses due to consumption of these products. Many clinical laboratories do not test for nonO157 Shiga toxinproducing E. coli STEC,  such as STEC O103 because it is harder to identify than STEC O157. People can become ill from STECs 28 days average of 34 days after consuming the organism. Most people infected with STEC O103 develop diarrhea often bloody,  and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment;  antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended. Most people recover within a week,  but,  rarely,  some develop a more severe infection. Hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS is uncommon with STEC O103 infection. HUS can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old,  older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. It is marked by easy bruising,  pallor,  and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in customers freezers.",

In addition,  serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higherrisk categories who experience flulike symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them.

The Centre for Food Safety CFS immediately contacted the sole agent of Lactalis in Hong Kong,  major local importers and retailers to follow up. Preliminary investigations showed that the products concerned had not been imported or sold in Hong Kong. The CFS issued a food incident post to inform local trade of the incident on December 4. Following the French authorities announcement on December 10 that the recall of products by Lactalis has been extended to cover all products produced by one processing plant Lactalis Craon Factory since February 15,  2017,  the CFS has been proactively following up on the incident. CFS investigation showed that the importer concerned had imported about 28 000 cartons of the affected products and some of them had been distributed for sale. Action Taken by the Centre for Food Safety The CFS has instructed the importer concerned to stop sale and remove from shelves the affected batches of the products,  and recall the products concerned. The remaining stock in the importers warehouse has been immediately marked and sealed by the CFS. In addition,  15 000 cartons are being shipped to Hong Kong which will also be marked and sealed by the CFS on their arrival.",

Cream Cheese Products - While there have been no reported illnesses,  out of an abundance of caution,  Panera Bread is conducting a nationwide preemptive,  voluntary recall of all 2 oz. and 8 oz. cream cheese products sold in its U. S. bakerycafes. This recall was initiated after samples of one variety of 2 oz. cream cheese from a single production day showed a positive result for the presence of Listeria monocytogenes. Tests on cream cheese samples manufactured both before and after the production run in question have all come back negative. Despite the finding in only one day of production,  Panera Bread is issuing a voluntary recall of all varieties of the 2 oz. and 8 oz. cream cheese. The products included in the recall are all varieties see below of unexpired 2 oz. and 8 oz. cream cheese products with an expiration date on or before 4218. This recall only affects cream cheese sold in Panera Bread United States bakery cafes and does not affect Panera Bread Canadian bakery cafes or any other Panera Bread food products. The safety of our guests and associates is paramount,  therefore we are recalling all cream cheese products sold in the US with an active shelf life. We have likewise ceased all manufacturing in the associated cream cheese facility,  said Blaine Hurst,  Paneras President and CEO. Only one variety of 2oz cream cheese from a single day yielded the positive result. Our intent is to go above and beyond for our guests. You should expect nothing less from Panera. According to the FDA,  Listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children,  frail or elderly people,  and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only shortterm symptoms such as high fever,  severe headache,  stiffness,  nausea,  abdominal pain and diarrhea,  Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.

Recalls Chicken Salad Products Due to Possible Salmonella Contamination - The Iowa Department of Inspections and Appeals and Department of Public Health issued a joint Consumer Advisory Issued for Chicken Salad Purchased at Fareway grocery stores on February 13,  2018,  advising consumers to throw away any remaining chicken salad product. The chicken salad product subject to recall was purchased from January 4,  2018 to February 9,  2018 in various weight containers from the deli sections in Fareway grocery stores. FSIS continues to work with state and federal health officials to determine if there are additional illnesses linked to this product,  including illnesses in states outside of Iowa. This product was sold at Fareway grocery stores in Iowa,  Illinois,  Minnesota,  Nebraska and South Dakota. FSIS will provide updated information as it becomes available. Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis,  one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea,  abdominal cramps,  and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons,  however,  the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults,  infants,  and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products,  including fresh and frozen,  and only consume chicken salad that has been cooked to a temperature of 165 F. The only way to confirm that chicken salad is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature,  http1. usa. gov1cDxcDQ.

S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS announced today. Temperature abuse,  during which the product was at temperatures greater than 60F for over five hours,  may result in the growth of the proliferation of Bacillus cereus,  Staphylococcus aureus,  Shigatoxin producing E. coli,  Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella. The frozen readytoeat and notreadytoeat meat and poultry items were sold from March 23,  2018 to March 27,  2018. The complete list of products,  product labels and UPC code numbers can be found here. These items were shipped to one Target retail store in Hawaii located at 1450 Ala Moana Blvd,  Ste 2401,  Honolulu,  HI 96814. The problem was discovered on March 27,  2018 when the company received temperature records of the shipment from the carrier. All inventory of the impacted items have been removed from the store and destroyed. Target notified FSIS that the product from the shipping container had been temperature abused on March 28,  2018. Bacillus cereusis a type of bacteria that can be found in a variety of foods that have been stored too long at room temperature. Emetic toxins produced by Bacillus cereus are characterizeed by nausea and vomiting occurring within 30 minutes to six hours after consumption of contaminated foods. Staphylococcus aureusis a common bacteria found on the skin and in the noses of healthy people and animals. Staphylococcus aureuscan produce seven different toxins that are frequently responsible for food poisoning. Most people infected with E. coli develop diarrhea often bloody and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment;  antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended. Most people recover within a week,  but,  rarely,  some develop a more severe infection. Some kinds of E. coli bacteria cause disease when they make a toxin called Shiga toxin. The bacteria that make these toxins are called Shiga toxinproducing E. coli,  or STEC for short. The most common type of STEC in the United States is E. coli O157H7. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.",

Individuals who are highly sensitive to milk protein who consumed caplets from these lots may experience symptoms common to a milk allergy including gastrointestinal issues or allergenic skin reactions. Even in those instances involving more intense reactions,  any anticipated effects are expected to resolve quickly and typically do not require medical treatment. Product was distributed nationwide through AdvoCare and our Independent Distributors. Affected product includes 15, 640 units of Muscle Strength,  Product code P3221 with lot numbers 7063341,  7082161,  and sold between November 15,  2017 March 29,  2018 and 48, 176 units of Nighttime Recovery,  Product code P3201 lot numbers 7081841,  7063321,  7052411,  7090471,  sold between December 15,  2017 March 28,  2018. No reports of adverse events due to a milk allergen had been reported prior to the recall. As part of a routine formula review,  a prospective manufacturer indicated the presence of milk in Ashwagandha,  a raw ingredient common to both Muscle Strength and Nighttime Recovery. After AdvoCare was alerted to the possibility of trace amounts of milk in both products,  we immediately conducted an investigation and engaged a thirdparty health hazard evaluation. The investigation concluded that Ashwagandha was extracted using milk. Therefore,  trace amounts of milk can be detected in these specific lots. The risk of a mild or severe adverse reaction exists but is extremely low i. e. ,  less than 0. 5 of the adult population. AdvoCare suspended sales of Nighttime Recovery and Muscle Strength while issuing the voluntary recall. Communications were sent to all Distributors and Customers who purchased the affected product through the AdvoCare website. Distributors were instructed to contact any customer to whom they sold the product inperson using the sample email communication. If you purchased any of the affected product,  AdvoCare is urging consumers to call Customer Service at 1800 5424800 from 8 a. m. to 8 p. m. Mon Fri for a full refund or exchange of the product.",

The potential for contamination was brought to HyVees attention last night when approximately 20 illnesses in Minnesota,  South Dakota,  Nebraska and Iowa were potentially linked back to customers consuming the salad. The voluntary recall includes HyVee Spring Pasta Salads in both 1 pound 16 oz. and 3 pound 48 oz. containers produced between June 1,  2018,  and July 13,  2018,  and available from the deli service case. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  Salmonella is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children,  frail or elderly people,  and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever,  diarrhea which may be bloody,  nausea,  vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances,  infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections i. e. ,  infected aneurysms,  endocarditis and arthritis. The pasta salad was distributed to all of HyVees 244 grocery stores across its eightstate region of Iowa,  Illinois,  Missouri,  Kansas,  Nebraska,  South Dakota,  Minnesota and Wisconsin. The product comes in a plastic container with a plastic lid. The expiration date range is between June 22,  2018,  and Aug. 3,  2018. The expiration date can be found on the side of the container. Out of an abundance of caution,  HyVee voluntarily removed the product last night from all of its shelves and service cases as soon as the grocery chain was notified about the situation. Customers who purchased this product should dispose of it or return it to their local HyVee store for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact HyVee Customer Care representatives 24 hours a day,  seven days a week at 18007724098.",

The recall was initiated due to E. coli being detected in the well water and distribution system that supplies the firms operations. No illnesses related to the water have been reported to the state. Mauna Loa is voluntarily recalling their products out of an abundance of caution under the advisement of the Hawaii State Department of Health DOH. E. coli bacteria can exist in tropical,  subtropical and temperate soil and may persist in soil for a number of years. E. coli are bacteria whose presence indicates that the water may be contaminated with human or animal wastes. Microbes in these wastes can cause diarrhea,  cramps,  nausea,  headaches,  or other symptoms. They may pose a special health risk for infants,  young children,  some of the elderly,  and people with severely compromised immune systems. On Sept. 21,  2018 DOH notified Mauna Loa that a water sample in their distribution system was positive for E. coli. It was thought that a possible reason for contamination was the result of a disinfection system malfunction. Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corporation took immediate action to notify employees and the public within 24 hours of receiving notification from DOH of the possibility of contamination. It was advised that the Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Water System consumers and employees NOT drinkconsume the water while investigations continued. Subsequent test samples remained positive for E. coli and the State DOH has advised Mauna Loa to recall its products as an additional safety measure. The firm has been closed since Sept. 21,  2018 and will remain closed until the water clears State DOH drinking water standards. The DOH has been in constant communication with Mauna Loa regarding the issue to ensure all safety standards are being met. The products,  produced between Sept. 6 21,  2018,  and listed on the following pages are being recalled due to possible contamination with E. coli. Product Recall Information The above products were packaged in Keaau,  Hawaii and sold only in retail stores in Hawaii. Consumers who have purchased the recalled products should discard the products immediately or attempt to return them to the store where purchased.",

Issues Recall Due to Elevated Lead in Spices - Sirob Imports,  Inc of Lindenhurst,  NY is recalling,  Corrado,  Orlando Imports,  Nouris Syrian Bakery,  Mediterranean Specialty Foods Brand and Butera Fruit Market Curry Powder because it contains elevated levels of lead. Lead is a toxic substance present in our environment in small amounts and everyone is exposed to some lead from daily actions such as inhaling dust,  eating food,  or drinking water. In general,  the small exposure to lead within the U. S. population does not pose a significant public health concern. However,  exposure to larger amounts of lead can cause lead poisoning. While lead can affect nearly every bodily system,  its effects depend upon the amount and duration of lead exposure and age. Symptoms can include abdominal pain,  vomiting,  lethargy,  irritability,  weakness,  behavior or mood changes,  delirium,  seizures,  and coma. However,  infants,  young children and the developing fetus can be affected by chronic exposure to amounts of lead that may not result in obvious symptoms of lead poisoning. A child with lead poisoning may not look or act sick. Lead poisoning in children can cause learning disabilities,  developmental delays,  and lower IQ scores. The curry powder was distributed direct to the following states IL,  NJ,  and NY. The curry powder is packaged in 8 oz. and 16 oz. plastic containers and labeled with the following band names Corrado 16 oz. UPC 0 12729 01100 7 8 oz.

No illnesses have been reported to date. The recall was initiated after FDA sampling found elevated levels of lead in the product. The product sampling was conducted as a result of a consumer complaint regarding elevated blood lead levels in a child. The recalled product has not been definitively linked to this event but the investigation is ongoing. Consumers should not consume this product. Consumers who have purchased curry from Corrados,  Orlando Imports,  Nouris Syrian Bakery,  and Mediterranean Specialty Foods are urged to return it to the place of purchase for a full refund.",

Less commonly,  persons outside these risk groups are affected. Listeriosis can cause fever,  muscle aches,  headache,  stiff neck,  confusion,  loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women,  the infection can cause miscarriages,  stillbirths,  premature delivery or lifethreatening infection of the newborn. In addition,  serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higherrisk categories who experience flulike symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.",

For the sake of prudence,  the vendor has voluntarily stopped sale of and removed from shelves the abovementioned products,  and initiated a recall. Bromate is the ionic form of bromic acid in aqueous solution. In the Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality of the World Health Organisation WHO,  a guideline value of 0. 01 part per million per litre is set for bromate. The bromate in drinking water is formed during ozonation process of water. If a large amount of bromate is consumed,  people may experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea,  vomiting and abdominal pain. It may also affect the kidney and nervous system in severe cases. Although there is evidence suggesting that bromate can cause cancer in animals,  there is not yet sufficient data confirming that it can cause cancer in humans. the spokesman added. Action Taken by the Centre for Food Safety The CFS will continue to follow up and take appropriate action to safeguard food safety and public health. Advice to the Trade According to Section 54 of the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance Cap 132,  all food for sale in Hong Kong,  locally produced or imported,  should be fit for human consumption.

The fresh vegetable products include packaged varieties of butternut squash,  cauliflower,  zucchini and a butternut squashed based veggie bowl. Please refer to the detailed chart below for specific product names and retailers. The products originate from a Growers Express production facility in Biddeford,  Maine and were distributed to the states referenced in the chart below. The voluntary recall was issued due to the potential for contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. There are no reported illnesses. Listeria is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children,  frail or elderly people,  and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer shortterm symptoms such as high fever,  severe headaches,  stiffness,  nausea,  abdominal pain and diarrhea. Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. Most of the affected products are labeled with a Best If Used By Date of June 26 June 29,  2019. No other Growers Express products are impacted or part of this recall. This recall does not affect or include any Green Giant canned or frozen vegetable products. The safety of our consumers is our first priority,  said Tom Byrne,  President of Growers Express. We selfreported the need for this recall to the U. S. Food and Drug Administration FDA and stopped production immediately after being notified of a single positive sample by the Massachusetts Department of Health. We are deep sanitizing the entire facility and our line equipment,  as well as conducting continued testing on top of our usual battery of sanitation and quality and safety tests before resuming production.

The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea,  abdominal cramps,  and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons,  however,  the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available,  the retail distribution lists will be posted on the FSIS website atwww. fsis. usda. govrecalls.

The traceback investigation for one case patient identified the patient consumed ground turkey produced by Plainville Brands,  LLC. An intact,  unopened package of Plainville Brands ground turkey collected from this casepatients home tested positive for Salmonella Hadar and was closely related genetically to the sample from the patient. Evidence collected to date does not link all illnesses to this establishment. Based on the continuing investigation,  additional product from other establishments may be involved. FSIS continues to work with CDC and state and local public health partners on this investigation and will provide updated information as it becomes available. Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis,  one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea,  abdominal cramps,  and fever within6 hours to 6 daysafter eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons,  however,  the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults,  infants,  and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider. FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products,  including fresh and frozen,  and only consume raw ground turkey that has been cooked to a temperature of 165F. The only way to confirm the poultry item is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature,  httpswww. fsis. usda. govsafetempchart.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a microorganism found in the environment that,  if ingested,  can cause infection in immunocompromised individuals or,  rarely,  in very young infants. P. aeruginosa infections in immunocompromised infants are generally limited to hospital settings. In such settings,  there is the chance that the infants immature gut will not be able to prevent P. aeruginosa from gaining access to the blood,  and from there it can disseminate elsewhere in the body,  resulting in the possibility of serious adverse health consequences. This recall only affects two lots of the product,  Lot 100420218 and Lot 100520218,  UPC barcode number 856645008587. Lot numbers are located on the side of the bottle and on the bottom of the outer container in which the product is sold. No other lots or any other MaryRuths products are affected by this recall. This product is distributed nationwide through Target,  Amazon,  and direct sales from the companys website. The company is asking consumers to throw away product from both affected lot numbers. Impacted consumers may contact MaryRuths Customer Care Center to request a full refund,  please see contact information provided below. The company discovered the potential issue with one of its manufacturing partners during routine laboratory testing,  which is a part of MaryRuths vigorous quality assurance procedures and safety protocols,  and decided to take this precautionary measure. The only product complaint the company has received with respect to the affected product lots was one report of temporary diarrhea in an older infant after consuming the product,  which the company does not believe was related to the presence of the microorganism. We apologize for any concern or inconvenience this situation causes our customers and are here to support them,  said MaryRuths Founder and CEO MaryRuth Ghiyam. MaryRuths is dedicated to the safety,  health and welfare of its customers above all else,  and has invested heavily,  and continues to invest,  in safety and quality protocols to ensure we produce only the best products.

Members of the public should not consume the affected products. The trade should also stop using or selling the affected products immediately if they possess them.

The test results showed that both samples contained sulphur dioxide. Although the sulphur dioxide levels were below the maximum permitted level under the Preservatives in Food Regulation Cap. 132BD,  the functional class andor name of the additive were not declared on the food labels of the samples,  a CFS spokesman said. The CFS has informed the vendors concerned of the irregularities,  and instructed them to stop sale and remove from shelves the affected product of sample 1 and the affected batch of the product of sample 2 respectively. The abovementioned distributors have initiated recalls according to the CFS instructions. Members of the public may call the respective hotlines above during office hours for enquiries about the recalls. Prosecution will be instituted should there be sufficient evidence,  the spokesman added. Sulphur dioxide is a preservative which can be used in a variety of foods including dried vegetables,  dried fruits,  pickled vegetables and salted fish products. Sulphur dioxide is water soluble,  and most of it can be removed through washing and cooking. However,  susceptible individuals who are allergic to this preservative may experience breathing difficulties,  headache and nausea after consumption.",

People who have allergies to wheat,  run the risk of serious or lifethreatening allergic reaction if they consume these products. The recalled tortillas were distributed nationwide through the mail,  following orders made via the social media platforms,  FaceBook and Instagram. The recalled tortillas were also sold at various Farmers Markets in Texas the months of August and September 2021. Farmers Market locations include Canton First Monday,  Lucas,  Texas Community Market,  St. Michaels,  Red Tent Market at Willowbend,  Luscombe Farm,  Rockwall,  Garland and Heath. The product comes in a clear plastic package marked with The Salsa Texan on the top and with the phrase GlutenFree on the label. Customers with Celiac disease and gluten sensitivity have confirmed illness following consumption of the recalled tortillas. The voluntary recall was initiated after it was discovered that the wheat containing product was distributed in packaging that did not reveal the presence of wheat. Subsequent investigation indicates the problem was caused by a temporary breakdown in the companys production and packaging processes. Production of the product has been suspended until FDA and the company are certain that the problem has been corrected. Consumers who have purchased The Salsa Texan tortillas marked GlutenFree are urged to destroy them if they have an allergy or sensitivity to wheat or gluten and may contact The Salsa Texan for a full refund for tortillas purchased in August and September,  2021.

FDA does not endorse either the product or the company. New York State Agriculture Commissioner Richard A. Ball today alerted consumers that AC Best Food Trading Inc. ,  located at 3608 Review Ave in Long Island City,  New York 11101,  is recalling Wife Plum due to the presence of undeclared sulfites and unallowed dye E123. People who have severe sensitivity to sulfites may run the risk of serious or lifethreatening reactions if they consume this product. To date,  no illnesses have been reported to this Department in connection with this product. The recalled Wife Plum is packaged in clear plastic jar which weighs approximately one pound. The product is coded 20211015 stamped on the bottom of the jar. The product was distributed nationally. Routine sampling by New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets food inspectors and subsequent analysis of the product by New York State Food Laboratory personnel revealed the product contained high levels of sulfites which were not declared on the label. The consumption of 10 milligrams of sulfites per serving has been reported to elicit severe reactions,  including anaphylactic shock,  in some asthmatics and sensitive individuals. Consumers who are sensitive to sulfites and have purchased Wife Plum should not consume it.

FDA approval of Viagra is restricted to use under the supervision of a licensed health care professional. Use of products with the undeclared active ingredient may pose a threat to consumers because the active ingredient may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs such as nitroglycerin and may cause a significant drop in blood pressure that may be life threatening. People with diabetes,  high blood pressure,  high cholesterol,  or heart disease often take nitrates. Among the adult male population who are most likely to use these products,  adult males who use nitrates for cardiac conditions are at the most at risk from these products.
